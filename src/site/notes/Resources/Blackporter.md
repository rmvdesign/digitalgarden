A **Blackporter** is a specialised type of porter, operating primarily in the galactic delivery industry. While most porters are responsible for legal deliveries and supply runs between various planetary systems, blackporters distinguish themselves through their involvement in the criminal underbelly of the galaxy. They are often hired by criminal elements to transport illegal goods, controlled substances, weapons, and other types of forbidden cargo.

Blackporters typically maintain a facade of legitimacy as regular porters working for the reputable delivery collective [[Narrative/Factions/Corporations/Porters United\|Porters United]]. This allows them to leverage their ostensibly legal positions as cover for their covert activities. As a result, blackporters are highly sought-after by criminal organisations, who value their ability to bypass security measures and various regulations in place throughout the galaxy.

With their dual roles as both authorised and clandestine delivery contractors, blackporters are highly skilled in navigating the complexities of interstellar trade and transport. This often involves mastery of various piloting skills, proficiency in subterfuge and evasion techniques, and a deep understanding of supply chain logistics.

Though the existence of blackporters is widely known, their exact activities and list of clientele remain largely shrouded in secrecy. Meanwhile, authorities throughout the galaxy continue to hunt down and prosecute these unlawful porters, in an effort to curb the spread of illegal goods and the criminal enterprises they serve.
