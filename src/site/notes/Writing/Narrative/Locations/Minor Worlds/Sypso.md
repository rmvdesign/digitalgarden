**Sypso** is a planet located on the lower east side of the galaxy, near [[Writing/Narrative/Locations/Minor Worlds/Iris\|Iris]] and [[Writing/Narrative/Locations/Minor Worlds/Pulaski\|Pulaski]]. It is known for its neoliberal culture, which has led to widespread exploitation of the planet's resources, but also technological advancements in artificial intelligence programming and financial technologies. 

Sypso is located in the same system and orbit as [[Writing/Narrative/Locations/Minor Worlds/Camia\|Camia]], causing frequent tensions between the two planets. The history and customs of Sypso have often been compared to those of the former United States and Mars by solar historians. The Sypsonians are known for their neoliberal values and capitalist economy, leading to exploitation of their own planet and resources. This has caused strife with the more eco-friendly and community-oriented Camians, leading to a complicated relationship between the two planets. Despite efforts to improve relations, tensions between Sypso and [[Writing/Narrative/Locations/Minor Worlds/Camia\|Camia]] continue to be a source of conflict in the region.
