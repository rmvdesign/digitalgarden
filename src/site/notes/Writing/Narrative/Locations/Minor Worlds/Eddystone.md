**Eddystone** is a space station complex located in the neutral zone. It is made up of a flotilla of ships that have been retrofitted and connected to form a self-sustaining community. Eddystone is known for its focus on art and technology, with many of its inhabitants working as artisans or programmers. 

The space station is located in a remote area of the neutral zone, and is largely self-sufficient, relying on its own resources for its daily needs. Despite its isolation, Eddystone is a hub for innovation and creativity, and is respected throughout the galaxy for its contributions to the arts and technology. 

Eddystone is a closed community, and very rarely new residents are invited into Eddystone. There's also very few instances of Eddystones leaving the commune to secure higher paying work in industry, which is a testament to their commitment to the ideals of open-source labour and personal liberty.
