The Theotech Corporate Sovereignty is a region of space governed by the megacorporation Theotech. Theotech is a leading player in the technology industry and has a monopoly on silicon wafer fabrication, which allows them to control the production of all electronics in the region.

In addition to their dominance in electronics, Theotech is also known for their work in the field of faster-than-light (FTL) travel. They developed the [[Writing/Narrative/Concepts/Tech/Realistics Drive\|Realistics Drive]], a propulsion system that allows spacecraft to travel at speeds faster than the speed of light. Theotech also controls the production of Theodyne, the fusion fuel and realistics catalyst that powers the [[Writing/Narrative/Concepts/Tech/Realistics Drive\|Realistics Drive]].

The Theotech Corporate Sovereignty is an independent government made up of TechLabs and EdgeLabs, two research and development complexes located on the outer reaches of space. These facilities conduct research and development in a variety of fields. Theotech's control over the production of silicon wafers, Theodyne, and the [[Writing/Narrative/Concepts/Tech/Realistics Drive\|Realistics Drive]] gives them a strong economic advantage, allowing them to fund and drive much of the technology industry's progress.

Theotech's significant power and influence has led to criticism regarding their monopolistic practices and lack of transparency. Some have raised concerns about the ethics of a single corporation having such control over critical technologies and resources. Theotech maintains that their focus on technological advancement and innovation benefits the inhabitants of the Theotech Corporate Sovereignty.

The Theotech Corporate Sovereignty is also home to the Light Fields, a region of deep space with extremely hot and bright stars. The Light Fields Power Plant is a facility that harnesses the energy of these stars in a manner similar to a directed Dyson Swarm.

The Light Fields Power Plant is a massive complex that uses advanced technology to capture the energy of the stars in the Light Fields and convert it into usable power. This power is then distributed throughout the Sovereignty, providing a reliable source of energy for the inhabitants.

The construction of the Light Fields Power Plant was a major undertaking, requiring the coordination of multiple teams of scientists and engineers. The technology used in the plant is highly advanced, and its operation is closely monitored by Theotech to ensure its continued efficiency and safety.

The Light Fields Power Plant is a critical component of the Theotech Corporate Sovereignty's infrastructure, providing a stable source of energy for the region. It is a testament to the technological prowess of Theotech and their commitment to driving innovation and progress.
