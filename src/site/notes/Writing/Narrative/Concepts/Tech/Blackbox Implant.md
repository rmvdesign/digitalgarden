**Blackbox Implants**, also known as **Blackboxes**, are neurointegrated augmentations that are implanted near the brain stem of an individual. These implants are designed to record every sensation experienced by the individual, including sight, sound, touch, and emotion. The recordings are stored in a buffer with a capacity of a few minutes, allowing the individual's final moments to be accessed after their death.

Blackboxes are primarily used by military personnel and extreme sports enthusiasts, as they provide a way to review and analyze the events leading up to a person's death. The recordings can be used to improve training and safety protocols, as well as provide closure to loved ones by allowing them to understand the circumstances of the individual's death.

Blackbox firmware is generic and simply records neural activity into the integrated storage, which is usually very small due to size constraints of the implant. There are however ways to extend the recording buffer's size, such as a direct-attach shard, which can be used to record experiences for backup or distribution - see [[Writing/Narrative/Concepts/Tech/Theotech Products/Theotech ReMem\|Theotech ReMem]].

While Blackbox Implants were once legal, they have since been made illegal in the World Unity following a lawsuit regarding memory privacy after a murder case was solved by using a blackbox recording in 23. Despite their legality, the implants remain popular among certain groups, such as pirates and mercenaries, who see them as a way to capture their last moments in case of unexpected death.

There are ethical concerns surrounding the use of Blackbox Implants, as they can potentially reveal sensitive information about a person's thoughts and experiences. There are also concerns about the potential for the implants to be hacked or accessed without the owner's consent.
