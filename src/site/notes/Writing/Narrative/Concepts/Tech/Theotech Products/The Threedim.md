The Threedim, short for Three-Dimensional Mobile Terminal, is a type of handheld device used for communication, computing, and entertainment. It was developed by [[Writing/Narrative/Factions/Theotech, LLC\|Theotech]], a leading technology company in the galaxy.

The Threedim is unique in that it uses a Quantum Grid to connect to a datacentre via quantum entanglement, allowing for fast and secure communication and data processing. The device itself has no internal computing capabilities, as all processing is done at the datacentre.

The Threedim is available in a range of models, including the GlassType and GlassType Pro, as well as tablets and laptop-style computers. It is known for its ability to project 2D and 3D images, making it a versatile and popular device for a variety of applications.

The destruction of one of the planets in the galaxy that housed a quantum exchange and datacentre resulted in the permanent loss of connectivity for the Threedims that were connected to it. This has raised questions about the resilience and reliability of the technology, as well as the potential consequences of its widespread use.

Despite these challenges, the Threedim remains a popular and influential piece of technology in the galaxy. Its unique capabilities and functionality continue to make it a valuable tool for communication, computing, and entertainment.
