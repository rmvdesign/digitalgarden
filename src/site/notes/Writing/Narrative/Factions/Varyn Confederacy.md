The [[Writing/Narrative/Species/Varyn\|Varyn]] Confederacy is a group of silicon-based gelatinous aliens known as the [[Writing/Narrative/Species/Varyn\|Varyn]], who live on a single planet called Planet [[Writing/Narrative/Species/Varyn\|Varyn]]. The planet is entirely made of Silicon Dioxide, the same material that the [[Writing/Narrative/Species/Varyn\|Varyn]] are made of.

The [[Writing/Narrative/Species/Varyn\|Varyn]] did not develop individuality or sentience until they made contact with the [[Writing/Narrative/Species/Navareans\|Navareans]], an intelligent alien species. This encounter sparked a period of rapid cultural and technological development for the [[Writing/Narrative/Species/Varyn\|Varyn]], who were previously a primitive species.

Since first contact with the [[Writing/Narrative/Species/Navareans\|Navareans]], the [[Writing/Narrative/Species/Varyn\|Varyn]] have adopted an unspoken rule of "being nice to one another", which has led to the absence of a formal government in [[Writing/Narrative/Species/Varyn\|Varyn]] society. Instead, the [[Writing/Narrative/Species/Varyn\|Varyn]] rely on a decentralised system of decision-making and cooperation to govern their society.

The [[Writing/Narrative/Species/Varyn\|Varyn]] do not have cities or any architecture, and their language is simple. However, they have developed a sophisticated system of trade and commerce, allowing them to acquire the resources they need to survive and thrive on their planet.

Despite their lack of a formal government, the [[Writing/Narrative/Species/Varyn\|Varyn]] are a tight-knit community and are known for their kindness and cooperation with one another. They have a unique culture and way of life that sets them apart from other alien species.

In addition to their advanced trade and commerce systems, the [[Writing/Narrative/Species/Varyn\|Varyn]] are also known for their hedonistic tendencies. They place a strong emphasis on pleasure and the finer things in life, and their society is geared towards maximising enjoyment and personal fulfilment.

The [[Writing/Narrative/Species/Varyn\|Varyn]] Confederacy is known for its love of pleasure and enjoyment, and this is reflected in the development of their second planet, Tidēs. The [[Writing/Narrative/Species/Varyn\|Varyn]] terraformed Tidēs, transforming it into a world-sized holiday resort.

Tidēs is known for its countless resorts, which offer a wide variety of experiences and amenities. The planet boasts many different biomes, from lush forests and verdant jungles to arid deserts and frozen tundras. In addition, the oceans of Tidēs are heated, providing a comfortable and enjoyable swimming experience.

One of the most notable features of Tidēs is the way in which it has been designed to resemble different areas of the world. Visitors to Tidēs can explore recreations of famous landmarks and landscapes from Navareo, Tallis, as well as other planets.

Tidēs is considered the best vacation destination in the galaxy, and it is a popular destination for travellers from all over the universe. The [[Writing/Narrative/Species/Varyn\|Varyn]] have truly created a paradise on Tidēs, and it is a testament to their love of pleasure and enjoyment.
