Welcome to the worldbuilding repository for [Ruby](https://rmv.fyi/)'s worldbuilding project Onyx Black.

Onyx Black is a balanced-dark science fiction world with an emphasis on individual characters and their impact on the galaxy. It is galaxy-wide in scope. It focuses on the world after the Death of Earth, the extinction of the human race in 2119. Humanity has left behind their collective knowledge in an attempt to preserve something of theirs, and it was found about two hundred years later by an exploratory FTL spacecraft. Determined not to repeat the mistakes that led humanity to extinction, the galactic community came together to use the many advancements of humanity for the best.

It hasn't been going very well.
