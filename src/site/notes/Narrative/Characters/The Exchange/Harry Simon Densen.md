Harry Simon Densen is a Tallisite man in his early twenties. Standing at 6'3, he is tall and slender with a lean build. He has dark brown hair that he keeps neatly styled and a clean-shaven face. Harry is a quiet and reserved individual, with a calm and collected demeanor.

Despite his generally good nature, Harry is not particularly passionate about his job as a mail room employee at the [[Narrative/Locations/On-Planet Locations/Tallis/Tallis City/QEX-TC1 Quantum Exchange\|QEX-TC1 Quantum Exchange]]. He took the job primarily for the steady income and the opportunity to work his way up the corporate ladder. Nobody really cares about him, and most of his time at work is spent reading or lounging in the mail room. He has a minor crush on his co-worker [[Narrative/Characters/The Exchange/Samantha Atwood\|Samantha Atwood]].

In his free time, Harry is a dedicated student at the Tallis Institute, where he is pursuing a degree in computer science. He hopes to one day use his knowledge and skills to secure a more fulfilling and meaningful career in the tech industry.
