Chief of security on [[Narrative/Locations/Worlds/Galathea Station\|Galathea Station]] Willow is a Navarean expat who served with the Navy for almost ten years before being honourably discharged and heading up security operations on [[Narrative/Locations/Worlds/Galathea Station\|Galathea Station]]. She's feminine, but this does not mean she's not a very competent and experienced investigator and squad commander. She's close with [[Narrative/Characters/Daedalus Plan/Officer Fillion\|Officer Fillion]] while they do not consider themselves friends, they are good colleagues who play to each other's strengths very well.
