Chief of security on Galathea Station Willow is a Navarean expat who served with the Navy for almost ten years before being honourably discharged and heading up security operations on Galathea Station. She's feminine, but this does not mean she's not a very competent and experienced investigator and squad commander. She's close with [[Narrative/Characters/Daedalus Plan/Officer Fillion\|Officer Fillion]] while they do not consider themselves friends, they are good colleagues who play to each other's strengths very well.
