# Physical description

Chase is a Q1-K series [[Narrative/Concepts/Tech/Q-Series Android\|android]] modelled for grounders. He's not much taller than 6 feet and has an athletic and toned Lightspeed Iridium+ body. His skin is Carolina blue and his short holographic hair is a darker cerulean colour. When not in [[Narrative/Factions/Interstellar Police Department\|ISPD]] uniform, he usually wears a combination of graphic tees and grey to taupe slacks. He has a fondness for leather jackets and usually decorates them with a yellow and orange [[Narrative/Concepts/Tech/Q-Series Android\|android]] pride enamel pin. His LSI-3x3 data port can be found in his shoulder, and he takes care to cover it up for security, as it can be used to access his mind almost completely.

# Personality

Chase is a no-nonsense cop who often takes the "bad cop" role in his duo. He's efficient, smart and confident in his abilities, however this extends to his personal life in a limited fashion. Due to his upbringing in a wealthy family as their personal assistant [[Narrative/Concepts/Tech/Q-Series Android\|android]], he never did have time or the opportunity to form a personality of his own and explore facets of his self like hobbies, art and romance.

As such, he is naturally insecure. He gets easily flustered in any social situation he is supposed to take an active and equal part in, like parties, social gatherings, work functions. He is also quite easily intimidated by the people he finds attractive. He is asexual and sex-repulsed, but heteroromantic.
