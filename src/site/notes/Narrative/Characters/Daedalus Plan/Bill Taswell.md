The practical embodiment of the rich grounder stereotype, Executive Editor Winfred Ian Taswell writes for the galaxy's biggest newspaper and lives on Tallis with his husband Austin and two daughters Julie and Marie. While he usually likes to work on op-eds and more involved projects compared to field reporting, he joins Morgana and Fillion in search of the adventure of a lifetime.

# Physical description

Bill is a Tallisite man in his thirties. He's about 5'9, a little bit on the chubby side and wears his brown hair in a regular haircut. He likes to wear white button-down shirts and denim or corduroy pants with loafers, but no socks. He also wears a pair of rectangular glasses to correct his myopia, and as these glasses are "his style", he doesn't consider laser correction or augmentation to correct his vision impairment permanently. He also regularly shaves his facial hair, leaving behind a very short stubble. During Phyrra's Spark, he lets his moustache grow out.

# Personality

A member of the upper middle class, Bill considers himself to be an upstanding citizen. He considers his family the most important thing in his life, with his job in as a close second. Before the events of Daedalus Plan, he lives a happy and content life with his husband and children. Being an executive editor for the IPI, he mostly writes articles and longer review pieces. He hates getting put in the field for hands-on reporting, mostly because he suffers from homesickness very easily.

Bill is, for all intents and purposes, a coward. He is the epitome of a type-b personality: He is not at all brave or heroic, but rather backs down in the face of conflict. Bill is afraid of many things, especially conflict and public speaking. He's not one to take a conflict head-on, but rather relies on his wit and intelligence to solve arguments, although of course, he'd rather he didn't.
