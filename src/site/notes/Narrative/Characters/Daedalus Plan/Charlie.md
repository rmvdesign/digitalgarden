An accelerated augmented Navarean clone, Charlie Augustine is an esteemed augmentation designer who lives on the [[Narrative/Locations/Arcology Six\|Vi Station]]. Being only three years old, Charlie is very childish and erratic but has their girlfriend/caretaker [[Narrative/Characters/Daedalus Plan/Lola\|Lola]] to compensate for this mild insanity.

# Physical description

Charlie is a stationeer and as such has been supplied with enough gravity drugs to keep their body in a generally healthy manner. In addition, they are one of the first accelerated clones: They have been injected with growth hormones and accelerating factors to develop to a fully adult body in a manner of days. This process is, on the physical level, without any major drawbacks (aside from minor joint pain later in life and a generally reduced lifespan), however the psyche does not develop accordingly. To work around this, Charlie has been implanted with an augment core that provides them with simple mental abilities like the ability to speak, understand, read and write, basic arithmetic and any information considered common knowledge.

Charlie has the same electric blue hair as their genetic precursor and usually wears it in a random unkempt manner. They are non-binary and present in an androgynous fashion. Very few beard hairs can be found on their face - these are genetically implanted as well.

Shortly after the cloning process, they were spaced by [[C-Null\|C-Null]] and left for dead in the dead space behind Sgt.A*. Charlie's seemingly lifeless corpse was picked up by a blackporter named [[Narrative/Characters/Daedalus Plan/Lola\|Lola]] for a proper burial, but turned out to just barely cling on to life. Their left arm and leg along with one of their eyes and several internal organs were not able to be salvaged, and as an act of charity were replaced with augmentations by pirates that owed [[Narrative/Characters/Daedalus Plan/Lola\|Lola]] a favour. After that, Charlie gained Navarean citizenship and moved to an emergency quarter on the [[Narrative/Locations/Arcology Six\|Vi station]]. From there, they started to study augmentation design by themselves, eventually making a name for themselves in the custom augment scene.

# Personality

Charlie is incredibly childish and short-sighted. Due to the arrested development brought on by the accelerated cloning process, Charlie is - mentally, at least - still very much a young child. However, they are still sapient and more or less intelligent. They have passed the Lightspeed Regulation Test and are therefore granted full human rights and complete legal accountability, practically being of legal age at the physical age of only three years during the events of [[Narrative/Narration/Daedalus Plan\|OB1]].

Charlie prefers to act before thinking. Undeniably, they are a natural in the field of cybernetic augmentation, but that doesn't mean that they act any less irrational. Their motto is "Thinking about it has never helped anyone", and they act accordingly.

However, Charlie is incredibly curious. Due to them not having a childhood, or at the very least still living through it, they thrive on anything new they can pull apart and study. Their girlfriend [[Narrative/Characters/Daedalus Plan/Lola\|Lola]] has weaponised this tendency by turning their affinity and curiosity into an occupation in the form of Studio Augustine.
