Grown and raised on [[Narrative/Factions/Interstellar Police Department\|ISPD]] precinct 21-A, Morgana Terry Atwood is an idealistic and good-natured police officer who is obsessed with puzzles and tries to fill the void in her soul with solving increasingly elaborate cases with her partner [[Narrative/Characters/Daedalus Plan/Chase\|Chase]]. One of [[Narrative/Concepts/Folklore/The Parallel Descendants\|The Parallel Descendants]].
# Physical description

Morgana is a young Tallisite woman in her twenties. At the beginning of the events in [[Narrative/Narration/Daedalus Plan\|Daedalus Plan]], she is 24 years of age. Grown and raised on an [[Narrative/Factions/Interstellar Police Department\|ISPD]] precinct station, she is a stationeer and therefore her body adjusted well to the lower spin gravity on the station. She is one of the [[Narrative/Factions/Interstellar Police Department\|ISPD]]'s clones, made in an effort to ensure employment at the [[Narrative/Factions/Interstellar Police Department\|ISPD]] over the long term. Of the 22 sisters of the Atwood family, only Morgana and her sister Delilah still work for the [[Narrative/Factions/Interstellar Police Department\|ISPD]]. Being a clone, she does not have a navel.

Morgana has long dark brown hair and pale white skin. She is about 5'4" (162 cm) and slightly overweight, but just barely so. Her eyes are the same dark brown as all her sisters' and she's rarely seen without a Harrington jacket. Her preferred outfits include a comfortable and simple shirt and pants, and she prefers to wear magnetised loafers instead of the full gravity boots if possible. Her corneas are lightly scarred from the laser array in her NVR headset, an injury common among recovering NVR addicts.

# Personality

Morgana Terry Atwood is a good-natured idealist, arguably to a fault. She likes to believe in the natural desire to be and do good in the world, even if this trust may be utterly misplaced. Despite this, and a nearly unhealthy amount of naivety, she is still very intelligent. She is very quick to pick up patterns and make connections, an asset vital to her work as a detective.

While she does not have many friends, the ones she does have she also considers her closest confidantes. The list of these people is very short, though: Aside from her partner [[Narrative/Characters/Daedalus Plan/Chase\|Chase]] and her sister Delilah she does not have many social contacts.

Due to the nature of her residence aboard Precinct 21-A, she also doesn't really take up many hobbies. To work around this, she owns a [[Narrative/Concepts/Tech/Theotech Products/Theotech HeadSpace\|Theotech HeadSpace]] [[Narrative/Concepts/Tech/Neural Virtual Reality\|Neural Virtual Reality]] headset the uses to spend her free time in virtual. However, this has drawbacks - she eventually developed an addiction to the virtual world she is fighting during the events of [[Narrative/Narration/Daedalus Plan\|OB1]], especially virtual puzzles. She loves puzzle adventures, enjoys Sudoku puzzles and can't sleep if there's a riddle that goes unsolved.
