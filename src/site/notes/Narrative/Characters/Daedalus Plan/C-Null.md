**Constance Augustine** (·𐑒𐑭𐑯𐑕𐑑𐑩𐑯𐑕 ·𐑭𐑜𐑩𐑕𐑑𐑰𐑯, born 40-1823.22), also known under the pseudonym **C-Null** (·𐑕𐑰-𐑯𐑩𐑤), is a Navarean terrorist, anarcho-syndicalist and former xenobiologist. Being the youngest ever graduate and Lord of Science recorded in the history of the Navarean Academy of Applied Sciences, she was a prodigy in the field of reproductive cloning, xenoneurology and augmentation technology, but abandoned her academic career following expulsion in 56 to pursue an anarchist life in the Neutral Zone. Following drastic reorganisation of opposing pirate and mercenary groups, she founded the anarchist federation **[[Narrative/Factions/Sector C-Null\|Sector C-Null]]**.

In 56, Augustine abandoned her previous life on Navareo following her academic expulsion. The official reason for her dismissal is stated as various violations of ethics guidelines, but the details of this dismissal are confidential and have not been released to the public. The night following expulsion, she broke into her former research complex and retrieved her research, as well as stealing equipment the value of approximately Cr70.000 and a Faraday Cargo 100T starship. The following weeks she spent on a hyperlight flight to uncharted territory within the neutral zone, where she started studying the sociopolitical systems and tensions between criminal organisations. In the subsequent year she started offering charity and free medical care to anyone in need, making sure to offer her services to everyone without regarding their aligned faction, which she then weaponised to force many pirate and mercenary syndicates to work together, creating [[Narrative/Factions/Sector C-Null\|Sector C-Null]]. This federation continues to exist and subscribes to socialist values, exerting a powerful force over the Neutral Zone.

Augustine is subject of one of the longest investigations of the [[Narrative/Factions/Interstellar Police Department\|Interstellar Police Department]]'s Organised Crime section (ISPOC) and while she has been convicted of numerous crimes including motor vehicle theft, violation of the cloning accords, several counts of murder, practicing medicine without a license, several counts of kidnapping and an extensive list of war crimes, all attempts to arrest her have so far been unsuccessful.

# Early Life

## Childhood

Constance Augustine was born on 40-1823.22 in Elci'ere, an outskirt labour base on the former penal colony of Airesem, Navareo to three working-class parents, Allycera, Ilus and Thevov, all of whom were employees of the local durite manufacturing plant as an only child. They married in 36, although records of their marriage have since been lost.

Augustine's parents are on record for being hard-working and efficient, but with little regard for the wellbeing of themselves and their daughter. All three parents had to work five hour shifts daily, leaving little time for Constance's education. She is said to have kept to herself most of the time, studying school subjects intently and showing a vast interest in biology and computer science.

For essential school, Augustine attended the Elci'ere General Education Facility from which she would quickly transfer to Airecen, where she was placed into sixth grade at the age of eight. Initial testing and neuroplasticity scans revealed her assessed cognitive value (ACV) to be 1422, a very high value for anyone, but especially uncommon in adolescent individuals since the ACV test not only measures cognitive ability, but also general purpose knowledge and vocabulary.

## Navarean Academy of Applied Sciences

After graduating primary school, Augustine was granted one of the five Jezibah scholarships for gifted schoolchildren to apply to the [[Narrative/Species/Navareans\|Navareans]] Academy of Applied Sciences with any major/minor combination. Being the first colonist to be granted this honour, she accepted and chose xenobiology as her major and computer science as her minor. Despite high gravity being a major obstacle in her way, she successfully enrolled and graduated within the minimum time possible and attained the Academic Master degree in bioinformatics, finishing with a grade point average of the maximum 10.

During this time, Augustine was suffering from chronic pain due to the high gravity of the Navarean homeworld and was prescribed painkillers, which she briefly became addicted to until her first augmentation. After a visit to the campus physician, he suggested Augustine should consider skeletal augmentation surgery to strengthen her body and help her withstand higher gravity.

Over the course of her studies and her subsequent fellowship, Augustine continued in augmenting her body in part from a fascination with the topic and in part from a growing desire to become more and more resistant to pain. While no medical records of these procedures exist, several augmentations installed in her body were installed without general or local anaesthetic. Namely, her leg prosthetics are modified versions of the Downstream FM-220X prosthetic legs, and are claimed to have been installed without anaesthetic, including the amputation of organic limbs. \[Missing citation]

After several violations of the cloning accords in her research projects involving her own DNA and recombined sets pulled from the public domain, Augustine was the subject of disciplinary action involving the NAAS ethics committee, which ruled in favour of expulsion.

Following her expulsion, Augustine was stripped of her academic credentials at the academy, but not her degree - the night following the ruling she gained access to the research laboratories and recovered her work, destroying the computers containing the only copies of her work and stealing the equipment instrumental to her work as well as a Faraday Cargo 100T starship. Authorities estimate the damages to be approximately Cr150.000, with Cr70.000 of this being stolen equipment.

# Rise to Power

Using the stolen starship as her mobile base of operations, Augustine travelled to an uncharted sector in the Neutral Zone to hide from the authorities and made contact with several mercenary gangs, some of which were hostile to her. When encountering a ship that was badly in need to repairs and its crew requiring medical attention, she offered her services free of charge. Said pirate ship turned out to be a member of a prominent pirate faction, who assured Augustine's survival in the weeks to come.

Augustine however chose to be independent. While the factions she helped were indebted to her, she never made it a point to use her allegiance to specific factions for personal gain and offered her medical and repair services to everyone in need, acting as a neutral anchor within the shifting faction politics of the neutral zone.

# Personality

C-Null is, ironically, very emotional. Since her endocrine system is heavily modified, it doesn't take much of a hormone to affect her very strongly. To combat this potential for immense mood swings, she can use the Reflex Booster augmentation to temporarily pause these emotional bursts. This only lasts for a period of several hours at max, so usually she is in a massive emotional flurry.

Doing her regular modus operandi, she is usually so incredibly focused that she works for days at a time, without sleep. She also regularly forgets to eat and drink, but thankfully, her augmented metabolism accounts for this, being able to run on battery power for about eight hours after her organic metabolism is completely exhausted.

She is a passionate scientist who's interested in many different fields of study, however the biggest ones would be ion-based energy weapon research and cybernetic consciousness transference using Quantum Lattice Cache (QLC) dyna-volatile memory. Her opus magnum is Centauri Starbase, a highly advanced planet-sized space station that draws power from the geothermal core of the planet it was constructed around. It not only carries the biggest ion displacement cannon built, but also enough QLC memory banks and quantum exchange computers to receive and store C-Null and her closest confidantes in the event of an emergency.

C-Null cares deeply about each and every one of her crew. Everyone who has pledged allegiance to [[Narrative/Factions/Sector C-Null\|Sector C-Null]] and has proven their worth is a friend to C-Null. She makes it her personal mission to care for her staff on many levels. This includes the excellent health benefits Sector members get, which includes augmentation maintenance, mental healthcare, free treatments for any illness and injury among other things.

She appears cold and intimidating to people who aren't members of the sector. However, anyone who works with her on Centauri Starbase will attest that she has a soft and caring side and will go the extra mile for every single one of her compatriots.

Although this is not known to many of the sector's members, C-Null enjoys musicals and preparing baked goods such as cakes, pastries, pies, quiches, cookies and fresh scones.
