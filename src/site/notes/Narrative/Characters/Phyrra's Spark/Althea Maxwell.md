**Althea Maxwell** is a well-known and respected news anchor and reporter for the [[Narrative/Factions/Corporations/Galactic Feed\|Galactic Feed]], the most popular video-based news outlet in the known galaxy. She has been in the industry for over a decade and has established herself as one of the top journalists in the business.

Maxwell is known for her sleek and stylish appearance, always impeccably dressed and perfectly coiffed. She takes great pride in her appearance and is not shy about flaunting it, often using her looks to her advantage in her career.

[[Narrative/Characters/Daedalus Plan/Bill Taswell\|Bill Taswell]] considers her his personal rival and greatest enemy, as he's always been jealous of her success and considers her to be less of a journalist than him, as she just reads the material she's been given instead of researching and writing.

Their first contact was at a press conference where [[Narrative/Characters/Daedalus Plan/Bill Taswell\|Bill Taswell]] was mistaken for [[Narrative/Characters/Daedalus Plan/Bill Taswell\|Bill]] *Maxwell*, and as such brought to Althea's seat. When she arrived, [[Narrative/Characters/Daedalus Plan/Bill Taswell\|Bill]] cleared up the misunderstanding, but their rivalry mutually began in earnest. Althea thinks a lot of [[Narrative/Characters/Daedalus Plan/Bill Taswell\|Bill]], but would never admit it - [[Narrative/Characters/Daedalus Plan/Bill Taswell\|Bill]] however considers her a vain and arrogant figurehead and an insult to journalism.
