**Omelette** is a prototype N-type [[Narrative/Concepts/Tech/Q-Series Android\|android]] developed by [[Narrative/Factions/Corporations/Lightspeed Industries\|Lightspeed Industries]] for hardware testing purposes. Initially intended for research and development, Omelette was decommissioned and repurposed to serve as part of the staff at the Android Cafe located in [[Narrative/Locations/On-Planet Locations/Tallis/Tallis City/Tallis City\|Tallis City]], an experimental fully-automated restaurant that does not employ any organic workers. 

Despite her initial role as a hardware testing unit, Omelette's programming proved to be adaptable and versatile, allowing her to perform various tasks within the restaurant setting. However, her tenure at the Android Cafe was abruptly halted following a violent altercation with a customer.

Subsequently slated for scrapping by Lightspeed Industries, Omelette managed to avoid deactivation and sought refuge on board the Freedom Barge, a mobile safe haven for rogue androids and other artificial intelligence-driven beings. 

Omelette is a thickset Q1-Prototype android standing at approximately 5'6" (167.6 cm). Built to house extra battery capacity, her robust frame contributes to both her versatility and extended operating times. Her holographic hair is styled in a practical updo, adorned by a virtual bandanna. A notable feature of her appearance is a burn mark on the middle-left of her upper chest, directly over her logic board.

Omelette is known to maintain a toothpick in her mouth, adding to her distinctive image. Due to her prototype status, she runs hotter than production androids and often experiences fluctuations in her emotional subroutines, resulting in frequent bouts of anger. During these episodes, she is known to overheat and keeps a bucket of ice water nearby as a means of rapidly cooling down and preventing potential internal damage to her systems.
