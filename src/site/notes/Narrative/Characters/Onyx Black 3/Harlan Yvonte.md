**Harlan Yvonte** is a veteran officer in [[Narrative/Factions/The World Unity\|The World Unity]]'s Relief Efforts Department (WURED). At the age of sixty, his appearance is characterised by a bald head, a slightly rounded face, a pair of spectacles perpetually resting on his nose, and an overall wearied but still congenially receptive demeanour.

Yvonte initially served in the Tallisite Department of Habitation before transitioning to WURED. His primary responsibility as a Tallisite officer was orderly civilian resettlement among integrated components of [[Narrative/Factions/The World Unity\|The World Unity]], furnishing him with decades of experience in handling large-scale evacuations.

With the catastrophic event of the Delton sun going supernova and the [[Narrative/Factions/Delta Kingdom\|Delta Kingdom]] on the brink of extinction, Yvonte finds himself at the forefront of organising the massive exodus of the Delton populace into [[Narrative/Factions/The World Unity\|The World Unity]]'s territories. His role is crucial, yet thankless â€” committed to saving countless lives while working often behind the scenes.

Yvonte leads a group of relief coordinators, each as weary and somewhat disillusioned as him. These coordinators are primarily former high-ranking officials from [[Narrative/Factions/The World Unity\|The World Unity]] who have, due to internal conflicts or favour-debt circumstances, found themselves reassigned to the relief sector. Together, they perform the thankless tasks, despite the endemic internal politics and the seeming lack of appreciation from [[Narrative/Factions/The World Unity\|The World Unity]]'s leading committees.

Harlan Yvonte, despite the unending hours and the undercurrents of dissatisfaction, remains committed to his duty. His disquiet is not born out of a lack of belief in relief efforts or distaste for aiding the displaced. Instead, it is the latent understanding that the department he faithfully serves is fundamentally undervalued, its crucial work undermined by [[Narrative/Factions/The World Unity\|The World Unity]]'s facade of progress and peace. Yvonte is acutely aware that if any sacrifices were to be made, his department would find itself first in line.
