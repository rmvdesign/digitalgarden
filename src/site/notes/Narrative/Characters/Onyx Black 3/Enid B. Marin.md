Enid Blyton Marin is a tall and well-trained Tallisite-Human hybrid with short pink hair and brown eyes. They are a skilled porter, delivering goods from [[Narrative/Factions/The World Unity\|the World Unity]] to the far reaches of [[Narrative/Factions/Corporations/Theotech, LLC\|Theotech]] EdgeLabs in the Neutral Zone. 

With a love of all things nautical, Enid can often be found sailing or fishing in their free time. They are known for their free-spirited nature and are not afraid to take on [[Narrative/Concepts/Society/Blackporter\|blackporter]] duties for [[Narrative/Factions/Sector C-Null\|Sector C-Null]] and pirate groups. Despite their unconventional lifestyle, Enid is respected by those who know them for their reliability and dedication to their work.

Enid was born on Date Line Farmstead in the town of New Anna on the Tallis Date Line, a settlement on the twilight zone between the light and dark side of the planet. Her ancestors were the only humans to survive the [[Narrative/Concepts/History/Death of Earth\|Death of Earth]], travelling to Tallis on a prototype human FTL ship. Due to the similarities between [[Narrative/Species/Tallisites\|Tallisites]] and Humans they were able to fit into the Tallisite society after learning the language, but kept to themselves on the Date Line, creating a business out of cultivating crops from their Seed Vault.

Enid comes from a long line of farmers, but was quickly disillusioned by this life. Not wanting to continue the legacy of the Humans and instead being fascinated with the galaxy and the endless solitude of outer space.

At age 20, they went out to the [[Narrative/Factions/Ring Worlds\|Ring Worlds]] to buy a refurbished but pre-owned cargo spaceship she'd later name the Pequod after Captain Ahab's ship. Then, after signing up with [[Narrative/Factions/Corporations/Porters United\|Porters United]], they started delivering large amounts of goods to lesser-trafficked areas of the galaxy such as the Northern Neutral Zone, EdgeLabs and C-Null space.

Because Enid is a generally confident person and isn't easily intimidated, they don't see the danger in delivering to the Neutral Zone. In fact, they're well liked by Pirates and C-Null operatives for their reliability and discretion. They've also been invited to many parties and hangouts, but have remained independent.

On one resupply run to [[Narrative/Factions/Corporations/Theotech, LLC\|Theotech]] EdgeLabs, Enid agreed to bring her back to the [[Narrative/Factions/Navareo Empire\|Navareo Empire]], but on their ten-day journey down the well they fell in love and decided to stay together for a little while. While Enid still fulfilled her porter duties, [[Narrative/Characters/Onyx Black 3/Bridget Marin\|Bridget]] mostly works on her own projects and improves the Pequod as much as she can.
