Gwen was about fifteen years old and grew up in Edinburgh before she was shot and killed by [[Narrative/Characters/Welcome to the Flipside/Paula Sinclair\|Paula Sinclair]] when her family was detained. She was wearing an oversized grey hooded sweater and a pair of loose blue jeans that were transferred with her into the afterlife when she was killed by three gunshots to the back. She's of average height and pale complexion and is on the chubbier side. That said, she's by no means under- or overweight. She's just average. Gwen's primary identifying trait is her almost waist long bright orange hair that she inherited from her parents. She has emerald green eyes, but these are almost always accompanied by tired shadows. Her death marks are three black dots on her back.

# Personality & Arc

Gwen is a pragmatic and analytical introvert that prefers to stay back and watch the chaos unfold, rather than prevent or further it. In the beginning of the story she's suffering from a major depression due to her not being able to recall her past life and her death, and this manifests in extreme grumpiness towards most people. In the beginning to middle of WTTF, she prefers to keep to herself and not build interpersonal relationships.

While she doesn't exactly have a short temper, it also doesn't take much to set her off. When she's highly emotional, be that in any axis - sad, angry, happy or fearful - she falls into a very strong Gaelic dialect.

Over the course of the story, she sees herself in her IF [[Narrative/Characters/Welcome to the Flipside/Connor Pierce\|Connor Pierce]] - both of them are cold, have trouble in social situations and prefer to keep to themselves, but Connor overcomes these troubles by fitting in with the AV club, while Gwen reconsiles her issues by proxy - she grows by helping Connor grow.

Gwen is aromantic and asexual, a fact made clear numerous times throughout the story when other characters try to hit on her.
