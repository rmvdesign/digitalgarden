Originally named Doroteya Pretrovka, Talia Brooks is a Russian child spy that was trained to be the perfect adoptive daughter, then be put in the American foster care system, where - at the height of the cold war - she was adopted by SoS Milton where she started to extract state secrets and broadcast them to the Russian Union. She was killed in 1963 in a car accident and became an IF, assigned to autistic boy Craig Mona. Slowly losing her mind, she remains attached to Craig, forcing him to send more worthless data to Russia. Her signal was picked up by the AV Club, specifically [[Narrative/Characters/Welcome to the Flipside/Yagi\|Yagi]], who then went to track it down.
