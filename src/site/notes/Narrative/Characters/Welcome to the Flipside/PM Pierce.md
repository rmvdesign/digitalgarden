Conservative Head of State Prime Minister Pierce is the antagonist of WTTF. He's the father of [[Narrative/Characters/Welcome to the Flipside/Connor Pierce\|Connor Pierce]].

# Physical Description

PM Pierce is attractive. There's no question about it - he's a tall slender man who's always perfectly shaved with a chiseled jawline and strong features. He's about thirty years of age. He was once even awarded the Sexiest Man Alive award by People Magazine and wears is brown hair in a perfectly styled business haircut and wears expensive tailor-made Armani suits.

# Personality

The PM is a manipulative superficial charmer - some psychologists would consider him a sociopath. He's an experienced actor who knows exactly how to act to get someone to do what he wants, and even have them believe them they want it. He's the leader of the Conservative Party of French Britain (CPFB) and lobbies for less government control and more funding for the army.

He's a convinced neoliberal, keeps going on about the wrong "mindset" and is a true believer in capitalism and the stock market. He also has expensive and gaudy taste, like gold and marble furniture and expensive sports cars like his beloved Bugatti Chiron.
