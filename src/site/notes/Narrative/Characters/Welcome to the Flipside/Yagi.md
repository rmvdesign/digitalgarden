[[Narrative/Characters/Welcome to the Flipside/Memory\|Memory]]'s brother David is overly protective of his sister and always protects her in every situation. He and his sister were adopted by a gay pair of wealthy Parisian lawyers and stuck together ever since. In the AV Club, he knows the most about actual AV - his hobby is citizens band radio and amateur broadcasting, and he's even contacted the space station a few times. He's adept with a magnetometer and can triangulate signals from his modified phone. He's also the one to propose the faithful trip to Sovpol'ye.
