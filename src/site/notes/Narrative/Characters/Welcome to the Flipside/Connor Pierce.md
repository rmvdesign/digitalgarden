Connor Jacques Pierce is of average weight and height. His hair is dark brown, just like his father - but beyond that, and the fact that they're both men, they couldn't be further apart. He is wealthy, but only because his father is. In fact, he even smells of riches - a subtle scent of wood and high quality eau de toilette follows him, but not because he applies it. It's a feature of the apartment and he is completely oblivious to it.

He lives on the Champs-Elysees with his father. This in itself it unheard of, as the Prime Minister either lives in London on Downing Street or in the Elysee Palace. Aside from Gwen, he'd never had anyone over in his apartment.

# Personality

Connor is a very reserved person. Due to his social anxiety he rarely gets outside, and even at school he doesn't have many friends in the beginning. Gwen helps him to get over this lack of friends and teaches him the value of friendship. He develops a crush on [[Narrative/Characters/Welcome to the Flipside/Memory\|Memory]].

His relationship to his father however couldn't be worse. [[Narrative/Characters/Welcome to the Flipside/PM Pierce\|PM Pierce]] is not only a workaholic and thus doesn't have much time to spend time with his son. Connor also disagrees with many of his conservative policies, and grows to resent him and his emotional distance very much.
