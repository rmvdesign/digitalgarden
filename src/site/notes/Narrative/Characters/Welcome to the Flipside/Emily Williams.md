A bubbly and happy MOA agent, Emily Williams is a good-natured and kind person who loves her friends above all else. She is also Gwen's first and best friend.

# Physical Description

Emily is a Japanese girl who grew up in the polar circle. She's a bit shorter than Gwen and very thin. Technically, she's about 30 years old when the story takes place, however her body is permanently locked to the apprearance of a 14-year-old girl. On the Flipside, appearance and features get locked after arrivals, with any modifications (like surgery or tattoos) resetting when the body is killed.

Emily likes to wear long cardigans over her work attire, which consists of a MOA staff shirt and a name tag that attaches to said cardigan

Her death marks are all internal as she died from total organ failure which was caused by infection with a designed gene therapy virus known as the Williams Vector, which was developed by her parents Carol and Hideaki Williams.

# Personality

Emily is an incredibly positive person by nature. In fact, she's very bubbly and it takes a serious beating to get her down emotionally. She loves her job at the MOA and is incredibly thankful for the Flipside. She died in the arctic and has never had any real friends or a real life, so this new life is a breath of fresh air for her.

However, she doesn't often go into detail about her death. The whole process is incredibly detailed and brutal, leaving her with mental scars of trauma that even counselling hasn't completely dealt with.

Emily is an open and outgoing person who rarely backs down. This is also how she gets to know Gwen - she just talked her up on the train for fun and kept being persistent about their friendship, which only bonded them closer together.

Emily is a lot like Leslie Knope (Parks and Rec) in that she compulsively takes care of other people when she doesn't know how to take care of herself. She gives great gifts, is constantly aware of everything that she knows about her friends and is caring to an overbearing degree - a friendship with Emily takes a lot out of you, but it will be the most loving and caring relationship you'll ever have with another person.

# Relationship to Gwen

[[Narrative/Characters/Welcome to the Flipside/Gwen Ferguson\|Gwen Ferguson]] is guarded and concerns herself with many things, but friendships and amicable relationships with others are low on that list. Thus, she is initially very suspicious of Emily and her motivations, and even lashes out at her a couple of times through the first and second act of the story.

She however comes around on that and warms up to Emily, and they soon form a friendship that is - one sided as it may appear - genuine and built on mutual respect for one another. While Gwen could never be that, and while she certainly would never start a relationship by just talking to random people or take a purely utilitarian action as a segue into a platonic conversation, she certainly likes the relationship that sprang from it in her case.

Emily instead initially has many problems in her personal life. She struggles with performing well at her job, feels like she doesn't get enough out of her afterlife and doesn't have any hobbies really. Subconsciously, she tries to compensate for that lack of joy in her life with friends, and she sees Gwen as someone who wouldn't necessarily enjoy her friendship, but certainly one that could be worn down by it. While this may sound Machiavellian, Emily is by no means motivated by some grand plan - she's just lonely and wants some companionship from someone she doesn't work with.
