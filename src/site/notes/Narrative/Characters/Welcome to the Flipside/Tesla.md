Leader of the AV Club, James Lilac aka Tesla's specialty is electrical systems and impromptu inventing. Together with [[Narrative/Characters/Welcome to the Flipside/Memory\|Memory]], [[Narrative/Characters/Welcome to the Flipside/Yagi\|Yagi]] and Connor he forms the AV Club.

Tesla is a sarcastic and at times even abrasive person, but has a heart of gold. He'd do anything for the AV Club and his friends, and he is undeniably genius. He's also got a French accent and even sometimes swears in French.

While he dies in the climax of WTTF by getting cooked by an over-the-horizon radar system, he does and up on the Flipside and becomes Gwen's first Arrivals case.
