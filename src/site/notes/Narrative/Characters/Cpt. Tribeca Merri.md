- **Universal:** ·𐑑𐑮𐑲𐑚𐑧𐑒𐑩 ·𐑥𐑧𐑮𐑦
- *Name is apparently a ruinous word meaning "affluent and capable". Fitting.*
- **Rank:** Commissioner and Captain
- **Affiliation:** Interstellar Police Department
- **Base of Operations:** Tallis City, World Unity
- **Background:** A pioneer in the ISPD and a former Tallis City council member. Known for her rapid ascent through the ranks with a reputation for tightly integrating ISPD functions with local governance.
- **Appearance:** Distinct angular facial structure, meticulous grooming, and a preference for a flawless uniform and makeup signal her attention to discipline and order.

- **Under Duress:** Exhibits steadfast calmness, even in the direst of circumstances. Known for maintaining a cool head during high-pressure situations, which might border on the unnervingly serene.
- _Does she meditate, or is she a secret adrenaline junkie? Maybe both._
