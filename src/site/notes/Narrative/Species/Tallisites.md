The Tallisites are a humanoid species native to the planet Tallis, located in the [[Narrative/Factions/Sundom of Eris\|Sundom of Eris]]. They are genetically similar to humans, with some minor differences that allow them to thrive in the low UV radiation environment of their homeworld.

Tallisites are known for their unique appearance, with pale skin and deep brown hair. They also tend to be taller and thinner than humans, with a more slender build. Despite these differences, Tallisites and humans are theoretically able to interbreed and produce healthy offspring.

Tallisites have a rich history and culture, with a focus on the arts and intellectual pursuits. They are known for their love of literature, music, and the visual arts, and have a strong tradition of education and learning.

Tallisites are also known for their highly advanced technological capabilities. They were the first species to develop faster-than-light travel, and their innovations in the field have allowed them to become a leading player in the galactic community.

In addition to their technological and cultural achievements, the Tallisites are known for their political system, which is a direct democracy founded on blank-slate law. This system allows any Tallisite citizen to propose changes to the law and hold referendums to determine the will of the people.
