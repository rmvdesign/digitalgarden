The Varyn (Varyn: VARIN) are a silicon-based, gelatinous species native to the planet Varyn. They are known for their unique physical characteristics, which include a translucent blue appearance under neutral light and a lack of traditional organs.

Before they encountered the [[Narrative/Species/Navareans\|Navareans]], an intelligent alien species, the Varyn were not individualized and were perceived as a single entity. The [[Narrative/Species/Navareans\|Navareans]] showed the Varyn the concept of individual consciousness, which sparked a period of rapid cultural and technological development for the Varyn. As a result, they developed language, a culture of cooperation and kindness, and advanced trade and commerce systems.

The Varyn are known for their hedonistic tendencies and their love of pleasure and enjoyment. This is reflected in the development of their second planet, Tidēs, which they terraformed into a world-sized holiday resort. Tidēs is considered the best vacation destination in the galaxy and is a popular destination for travellers from all over the universe.

Despite their advanced society, the Varyn do not have a formal government and rely on a decentralised system of decision-making and cooperation to govern their society. They are a tight-knit community and are known for their kindness and cooperation with one another.

The Varyn are unique among alien species due to their silicon-based, gelatinous physiology. It is unclear how their consciousness or physical functions work, as their biology is largely exotic and mysterious. However, their advanced trade and commerce systems and love of pleasure have helped them thrive and create a rich culture on their planet.
