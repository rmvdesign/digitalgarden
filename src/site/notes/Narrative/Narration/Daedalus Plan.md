< Morgana & Chase | Winthé shows his findings to augmentation specialist and designer Charlie Augustine, whom he met at a trade show. Morgana and Chase then steal the Memphis, modify its beacon in a nearby nebula to the Juno, toss out scrap to make it look like they died in an asteroid shower and make their way to the Vi Station.
> Fillion & Galathea | Fillion gets transferred to Wela and earns a promotion. Being wrongly targeted by Ebony Rose, he uses this misunderstanding to forge an alliance between security and the street gang.
< Morgana & Chase | Morgana, Chase, Charlie and Lola witness the destruction of Nav IV. Charlie rushes to the observatory and scans the remains for ion trails - it transpires that the shot was fired in a straight line. The trajectory lines up with the ion cannon on Delecara and Sgt.A*. Charlie reveals the suicides were caused by unknown code injection and mentions the name Hephaestus.
> Fillion & Galathea | Tensions on Galathea rise. Suicide numbers rise exponentially and security has their hands full trying to prevent a mass panic. C-Null arrives at Galathea and pretends to help. C-Null and Fillion start a secret sexual relationship.
# Act 3
< Morgana & Chase | Charlie proposes a way to find out more: Chase will remote into one of the androids on Delecara and try to find some clues as to how the cannon was fired and who did it. Chase recovers a memory drive from the enslaved and subsequently killed perpetrators and transfers it to Charlie's computer. As he's leaving to solve a conflict with Vi Station authorities, Morgana uses ReMem to relive the thousands of lives' memories Chase recovered.
> Fillion & Galathea | C-Null begins construction on the outpost. More and more suicides begin to crop up in Wela. Fillion and Wela security have trouble housing all the refugees, and minor riots break out that C-Null helps calm down. Fillion and C-Null have sex.
< Morgana & Chase | Morgana almost dies in ReMem, but wakes up with the knowledge of the slaves. While they did configure and fire the cannon, they were forced to by a demonic voice. Charlie assumes this to be Hephaestus and begins rebuilding the code framework.
> Fillion & Galathea | The Empire gets uneasy and begins diplomatic talks with Galathea Station, to which C-Null joins. The ISPD is also invited to the summit. Fillion joins as C-Null's Plus One. As a backup plan because he had a bad feeling about C-Null, he gives Taswell his gun and a key to the sector elevator. Taswell takes them.

Together with Sector C-Null, Galathea Holdings and Galathea Station will function as the new administrative centre of the Neutral Zone. As a representative of the ISPD, Captain Merri agrees. The Empire is appalled by this and leaves, and attempts to destroy C-Null's outpost. Her outpost parries the attack and the Navy ship is destroyed.

< Morgana & Chase | They make their way to the Exec level, through the tunnels. Charlie discovers that the Hephaestus signals are relayed through radio transmitters, and Hephaestus temporarily takes over Lola, but they can reverse the effects before anything happens. Bill Taswell joins them, threatening them with Fillion's gun.
> Fillion & Galathea | Dale commits suicide and Fillion finds his body. Shaken and distraught by this, he returns his faith garments to the local church of the Sundom. He begins to suspect C-Null has ulterior motives. Fillion and C-Null move over to the new base at the top of Galathea, preparing for the fleet of Navy ships to arrive. The battle of Galathea Station takes place, and the Chukhung and Delaney appear just in time to help C-Null defend Galathea. Galathea wins the battle, but the Director is a casualty.
< Morgana & Chase | On the bridge, the four hide out in the corridor until Charlie and Lola discovered by Captain Merri.

C-Null recognises Charlie and begins to torture Lola. Fillion steps in, but she takes him over.
> Fillion & Galathea | C-Null prepares to infect every augmented person with Hephaestus, even Fillion. He flashes back to the battlefield and reconciles his past trauma.
