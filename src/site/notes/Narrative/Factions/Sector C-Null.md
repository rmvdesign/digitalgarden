Sector C-Null is an anarchist federation founded and led by Constance Augustine, also known as [[C-Null\|C-Null]]. The federation is based in the Neutral Zone, an area of space not claimed by any particular government or authority. [[C-Null\|C-Null]] formed the federation by bringing together various pirate and mercenary groups under a socialist ideology and providing services such as charity and medical care to those in need. 

The federation is known for its opposition to any kind of authority and its willingness to use violent means to achieve its goals. [[C-Null\|C-Null]] and the members of Sector [[C-Null\|C-Null]] are wanted by the [[Narrative/Factions/Interstellar Police Department\|Interstellar Police Department]]'s Organised Crime section (ISPOC) for a variety of crimes including murder, kidnapping, and violations of the cloning accords. Despite numerous attempts, [[C-Null\|C-Null]] has so far evaded arrest.

The group is headquartered at the Centauri Starbase, a massive space station and ship flotilla complex located very close to the Sagittarius A-star black hole, where the intense gravitational forces make it invisible to the naked eye and scanners.
