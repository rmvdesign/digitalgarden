Lightspeed Industries is a multi-planetary corporation that specializes in the production of advanced starship parts, specifically engines and navigation systems. Founded by CEO [[Narrative/Characters/Phyrra's Spark/Hatena Mouru\|Hatena Mouru]], the company quickly gained a reputation for its high-quality products and innovative design. It is a wholly-owned subsidiary of [[Narrative/Factions/Corporations/Theotech, LLC\|Theotech]].

In addition to its core business, Lightspeed Industries has also ventured into the field of artificial intelligence. In an effort to develop more advanced AI systems, the company released the Q-Series Android, a household helper robot modelled after the Tallisite species. While initially met with lukewarm reception, the introduction of the N-type Neural Coprocessor, a device developed by CEO [[Narrative/Characters/Phyrra's Spark/Hatena Mouru\|Hatena Mouru]] that significantly improves the cognition and abilities of artificial intelligences, led to a major improvement in the product.

Despite the success of the Q-Series Android, the exact nature of the N-type Neural Coprocessor remains a closely guarded trade secret within Lightspeed Industries. Some rumors have circulated about the potential use of brain matter in the device, but the company has not publicly addressed these allegations.

Lightspeed Industries has a strong presence on several planets within the [[Narrative/Factions/Navareo Empire\|Navareo Empire]], with its headquarters located on the planet Tallis. The company is known for its cutting-edge technology and commitment to innovation, and continues to push the boundaries of what is possible with artificial intelligence and space travel.
