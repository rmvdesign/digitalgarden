The Delta Lane Network (DLN) is a transport group that has been operating for over a century, specialising in the maintenance and operation of the HyperLanes and HyperMetro systems. Established in the early years of galactic expansion, the Delta Lane Network has grown into a multi-sector corporation, serving thousands of planets and billions of commuters every day.

The HyperLanes are a network of hyperlight travel corridors that span across the galaxy, allowing for hyperlight travel between distant star systems. The HyperMetro system uses this network with large stacked ships colloquially called "trains", even though they are only in concept trains. Both systems are crucial for the transportation of people and goods across the galaxy.

The Delta Lane Network is known for its exceptional safety record and its commitment to providing efficient and reliable service to its customers. Its fleet of state-of-the-art hyperlight vessels and interstellar shuttles are equipped with the latest in navigation and propulsion technology, ensuring the smoothest and fastest journey possible. In addition to first-party starships, they also license the HyperDrive technology out to other OEMs and ODMs, which can integrate the technology into their designs.

The Delta Lane Network has invested heavily in developing more efficient propulsion systems for its vessels. Unlike traditional HL methods like the [[Narrative/Concepts/Tech/Realistics Drive\|Realistics Drive]], the HyperDrive does not require active manipulation of the fabric of reality to function - instead, corridors of altered space, Reality Pockets, get carved out by large shunting ships. HyperDrives can simply "adapt" to these "rails", allowing HL travel without having to maintain a bubble. Non-HyperDrive compatible navigation systems are programmed to avoid these rails.

With its reputation for excellence, the Delta Lane Network is widely regarded as the leading transport corporation in the galaxy. Its commitment to innovation, safety, and sustainability has made it a trusted partner for governments, businesses, and commuters across the galaxy.
