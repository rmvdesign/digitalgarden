Headquartered on the planet [[Narrative/Locations/Worlds/Pyramiden\|Pyramiden]], **Porters United** (𐑐𐑹𐑑𐑼𐑟 𐑿𐑯𐑲𐑑𐑦𐑛) is a workers' cooperative specialising in logistics and galactic deliveries. It is the largest co-op in the galaxy, and is run by collective decision making of all porters. Porters are the main working staff of Porters United and are most often independent delivery contractors that have voting powers and benefits through the co-op. Porters United only has a very small number of actual employees, instead choosing to contract their deliverypeople.

Porters are loosely organised through the backbone of the Porters United Network, which can be accessed through the PlaNet. Through the network, deliveries are assigned and bountied depending on the urgency and size of the delivery. Porters can accept or decline runs, and are rewarded according to the delivery time.

Porters United simply provides the delivery infrastructure and the network, but not the ships or supplies. Every porter is, technically speaking, their own self-employed business unit, but Porters United acts as healthcare provider as well as tax instance to provide benefits and financial security. This model does however also mean that there are no severance bonuses or protections, meaning employment can be terminated at any time for any reason.
