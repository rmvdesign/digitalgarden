The Interstellar Police Department, or ISPD, is an intergalactic law enforcement agency responsible for maintaining law and order in the neutral zone. It was founded following the signing of the Galactic Peace Accords, which established the neutral zone as a demilitarised zone between the various member states of [[Narrative/Factions/The World Unity\|the World Unity]]. The ISPD operates under the jurisdiction of the Galactic Council and is headquartered on Tallis at One ISPD Plaza.

The ISPD is organised into several ranks, starting with officers and detectives who are responsible for patrol and investigation duties. Above them are sergeants, lieutenants, and captains, who oversee the operations of their respective units. Inspectors and chiefs are responsible for the management of larger districts or regions, and the commissioner serves as the head of the entire agency.

The ISPD has a wide range of powers and resources at its disposal, including the authority to arrest suspects, confiscate property, and conduct investigations. It also has a specialised unit called the Galactic Peacekeepers, who are trained in advanced tactics and equipped with advanced technology to handle high-risk situations.

Despite its mandate to maintain law and order in the neutral zone, the ISPD has faced criticism for its perceived heavy-handed approach and lack of transparency. There have been several instances of misconduct and abuse of power within the agency, leading to calls for reform and increased oversight.

Shortly after its inception, the ISPD hired from the pool of many planetary militaries, but these officers were quickly disillusioned with the mundane nature of interstellar police work. Hiring soon stagnated, and the ISPD began to fund research into recombined cloning. 

Using this technology, the ISPD collected genetic material from all compatible officers and started cloning new officers from this pool in batches of 100 per larger precinct. Of these clones, usually only about 15  survive to birth and make it through the rigorous training and selection process to become full-fledged officers. These clones are highly respected within the ISPD for their dedication and loyalty to the department.

This has caused some controversy, as there are concerns about the ethical implications of cloning sentient beings for the purpose of labor. However, the ISPD argues that the clones are treated with the same respect and rights as any other officer, and that they provide a necessary solution to the shortage of qualified candidates.

The ISPD is equipped with a variety of advanced technology, including faster-than-light ships for pursuit and transport, and specialised armour and weapons for various situations.

The ISPOC is the organised crime division of the ISPD. It is responsible for investigating and combating organised crime within the neutral zone. The division is known for its use of undercover officers and informants to gather intelligence on criminal organisations. In addition to traditional detective work, the ISPOC also utilises advanced technology, such as surveillance drones and sophisticated tracking software, to track and apprehend suspects. Despite their efforts, organised crime remains a persistent problem within the neutral zone, with numerous criminal organisations operating in the shadows.
