The **Ring Worlds** are a region of space located on the western outer edge of the known galaxy. This region is inhabited by a species of reptilians known as the **Ring Dwellers**. These beings are highly advanced and have developed a hyper capitalist society in which the pursuit of wealth and power is the driving force.

The Ring Dwellers once lived on planets that were rich in valuable Theorium, the precursor to fusion fuel and reality catalyst Theodyne. This ore is highly sought after by other species for its unique properties, and the Ring Dwellers exploited their planets' resources to extract as much Theorium as possible. However, their mining operations were highly destructive, and over time, the Ring Dwellers' homeworlds were reduced to ruins.

Unable to continue living on their destroyed planets, the Ring Dwellers were forced to adapt. They constructed massive mining stations in the form of metallic "rings" that orbit the ruins of their old worlds. These rings are cobbled together from the remains of their destroyed planets, and they serve as the Ring Dwellers' new homes.

Despite the destruction of their homeworlds, the Ring Dwellers continue to mine Theorium and sell it on the galactic market. This has made them extremely wealthy, but at the cost of their own environment and way of life. The eerie metallic rings that now surround the ruins of their once-thriving worlds serve as a reminder of the price the Ring Dwellers have paid for their pursuit of wealth and power.
