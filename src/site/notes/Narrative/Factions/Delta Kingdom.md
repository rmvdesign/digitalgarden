The **Delta Kingdom** is the homeworld of the Delta, an amphibian bipedal species. The planet is known as **Delton**, and it is a barren desert wasteland for the most part. However, in the middle of the world, there are three towers that form an atmospheric tent across them. Under this tent is a lush green idyll where the Delta live.

The Delta Kingdom is very isolationist and xenophobic, and they have enslaved the Delecaran species, which is native to Delton. The Delta live in three cities that are located at the base of the towers: Monolith Town, Palace Town, and Ascension Town. These cities are the centres of Delta society, and they are known for their advanced technology and strict social hierarchy.

Despite their isolationist tendencies, the Delta Kingdom has a long and complex history. They have fought numerous wars with other species, and they have also engaged in trade with some of their neighbouring worlds. However, their xenophobia has often led to conflicts with other civilisations, and they have a reputation for being aggressive and unpredictable.

The Delta are known for their advanced technology, particularly in the fields of energy production and transportation. They invented [[Resources/The HyperMetro\|the HyperMetro]], and are also skilled engineers and architects, as evidenced by the towering structures that form the atmospheric tent over their cities. Despite their technological prowess, the Delta have a strict social hierarchy, with a ruling class of elite individuals who hold most of the power and wealth.

In recent years, the Delta Kingdom has faced increasing pressure from other civilisations to end their enslavement of the Delecaran species. While the Delta argue that the Delecarans are a primitive and inferior race, many other species view their treatment of the Delecarans as a gross violation of basic rights. As a result, the Delta Kingdom has become increasingly isolated and isolated, and it remains to be seen how they will respond to this growing pressure.
