The **Navareo Empire**, commonly known as **Navareo**, is a political and economic entity located on the South-western period of the galactic disc. It consists of 5 homeworlds, 22 colonies, 1872 outlying space stations and one arcology knows as the [[Narrative/Locations/Arcology Six\|Vi Station]]. The Navareo Empire shares celestial borders with the Southern Neutral Zone and the [[Narrative/Factions/Sundom of Eris\|Sundom of Eris]]. With a population of over 12 billion, it is the most populous entity in the known galaxy. The unified capital is the [[Narrative/Locations/Arcology Six\|Vi Station]], and the financial centre is Phyllis, primary capital of Navareo II.

The Empire is a capitalist pseudo-democracy with separate branches of government, including a dual-mode legislature. While it is, legally speaking, a liberal democracy, it is in fact overwhelmingly controlled through the Navarean Board of Citizens to which only high net worth individuals are admitted. The Empire ranks high in interstellar measures of sentient rights, wealth, quality of life and has low levels of perceived corruption.

The Navareo Empire is a highly developed entity and its economy accounts for approximately a sixth of galactic GDP. It is, by volume, the largest importer and exporter of goods. It is has the second-largest GDP of any galactic entity, second only to the [[Narrative/Factions/Sundom of Eris\|Sundom of Eris]]. It makes up more of half in galactic military spending and is the largest military power in the galaxy and a leading political, cultural and scientific force.
