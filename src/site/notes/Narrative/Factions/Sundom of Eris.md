The **Sundom of Eris**, not to be confused with **[[Narrative/Locations/Worlds/Tallis\|Tallis]]**, is a political and economic entity located on the Western period of the galactic disc. It consists of one homeworld, 2 colonies and 15 outlying space stations. The Sundom shares celestial borders with the Southern Neutral Zone and the [[Narrative/Factions/Navareo Empire\|Navareo Empire]]. Named after the solar centre of its homeworld, Eris, the Sundom is one of the most important entities in [[Narrative/Factions/The World Unity\|The World Unity]], as well as a founding member.

The Sundom is a direct democracy founded on blank-slate law. If a law needs to be changed or added, any Sundom citizen is allowed to start a campaign to add, change or remove any law. In order to pass, several referendums have to be held, with different rule sets for local and regional ordinances.

The Sundom of Eris consistently ranks highest in terms of development and economy. It has, due to its status as [[Narrative/Factions/Corporations/Theotech, LLC\|Theotech]]'s origin world, the highest GDP in the galaxy and still collects royalty taxes, a law implemented by the Tallisite High Court after the success of [[Narrative/Factions/Corporations/Theotech, LLC\|Theotech]]'s initial product runs.
