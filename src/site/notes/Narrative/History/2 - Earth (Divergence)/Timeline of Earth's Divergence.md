+ 12 March 1953
+ Fall of the Soviet Union
+ A spontaneous political overhaul, internally driven by changing political landscapes and a desire for a renewed national identity in the face of technological progress and the Europa Alliance, leads to the formation of the Russian Union from the ashes of the USSR. The birth of the Russian Union stokes the coals of the ongoing Cold War. The Union's new political outlook, coupled with its latent ideological friction with the European and American blocs, leads to a fresh surge of competition and suspicion.

+ An unprecedented global event, the 'Red Cosmos Broadcast', captures the world's attention. An unidentified transmission frequency broadcasts scientific data apparently from deep space. Authorities later trace it to a classified Russian Union interstellar project.

+ 18 October 1971
+ Apollo EA-14
