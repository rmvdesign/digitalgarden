```timeline
[line-2, body-1, active-color-interactive-accent]
+ Previous <br> iteration
+ The previous universe
+ The previous iteration of Reality ends. Entropy swallows every free spot in the universe. Heat death occurs, and time stops.

+ In-between <br> iterations
+ Setting up the new universe
+ The new iteration's setup is being assembled. Changes include: Organic molecules on [[precursor comets]]. An infinite number of [[precursor comets]] are set up throughout the timeline of the universe. The iteration is loaded.

+ Beginning of the <br> current iteration
+ The Big Bang
+ In the subsequent moments after the big bang, inflationary expansion, particle formation, and nucleosynthesis occurred as protons, neutrons, and electrons emerged. After roughly 300,000 years, the cooling and expanding universe allowed for the formation of atoms, eventually leading to the formation of celestial structures, such as stars and galaxies.

+ 12.5 billion <br> years ago
+ Formation of the Milky Way galaxy
+ Particulates accrete around a supermassive black hole, forming a barred spiral galaxy. First planets are formed, including Delton, and what would later become the Ring Worlds.

+ 9.5 billion <br> years ago
+ Formation of most worlds
+ Most worlds in the milky way galaxy are formed. This includes Navareo, Tallis, most minor worlds.

+ 4.7 billion <br> years ago
+ Formation of Earth
+ Earth accretes around the sun and forms itself.

+ 3.6 billion <br> years ago
+ [[Precursor comets]] seed life
+ The milky way galaxy is hit with a shower of [[precursor comets]]. PC-3 seeds life on Tallis, but a deterministic ripple sends it off course after its visit to Tallis and changes its course to Earth. A few million years later, PC-3 seeds life on Earth.

+ 1.2 billion <br> years ago
+ Formation of [[Narrative/Locations/Worlds/Varyn|Varyn]]
+ A former silicon nebula accretes and compacts into a large mass of silicon dioxide gel, taking on a light blue shine due. Over the next billion years, the planet slowly develops an intelligence network similar in concept to a neural network of nerve cells.
