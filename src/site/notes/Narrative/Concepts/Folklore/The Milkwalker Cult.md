The **Milkwalker Cult** (𐑞 𐑥𐑦𐑤𐑒𐑢𐑭𐑒𐑼 𐑒𐑩𐑤𐑑) is a doomsday cult that fervently believes in the prophecy of [[Narrative/Concepts/Folklore/The Parallel Descendants\|the Parallel Descendants]]. Founded centuries ago by an enigmatic figure known as the **Guiding Shepherd**, the cult developed a complex belief system revolving around the prophecy, focusing on how the universe is intrinsically tied to the fates of the Atwood sisters. According to the Milkwalker Cult's doctrines, the cycles of Reality are dictated by the lives and deaths of the 22 Atwood sisters, and that, as the last of [[Narrative/Concepts/Folklore/The Parallel Descendants\|the parallel descendants]], [[Narrative/Characters/Morgana T. Atwood\|Morgana T. Atwood]], is crucial to the initiation of the cataclysmic change that will bring forth a new era.

At its core, the Milkwalkers follow the teachings of the *Seven Phases*, as described in the prophecy: World, Life, Crystals, Pain, Loss, Detachment, and Revelation. The cult regards these phases as universal truths that guide the whole of existence and provide a blueprint for the universe's repetitive nature. They believe that the current iteration of Reality is filled with strife, suffering, and imbalance due in large part to the non-linear progression of the Seven Phases.

The **Seven Phases** form a central tenet of the Milkwalker Cult's beliefs and are said to guide the cycles of Reality as described in the prophecy of the **Parallel Descendants**. As a framework for understanding the universe, the Seven Phases are thought to encompass the myriad aspects of existence and create a blueprint for the repetitive nature of life and reality.

1. **World**: This phase symbolises the birth and creation of the universe, planets, and various life forms. The beginning of life's journey, it represents the potential for growth, the foundation of relationships, and the exploration of the unknown.

2. **Life**: It encompasses the experiences individuals undergo throughout their lives: significant milestones, advancements, sorrows, and joys. It emphasises personal growth and learning, taking into account both the collective and individualistic aspects of existence.

3. **Crystals**: Symbolic of untapped energies and hidden potentials, the crystal phase represents inward journeys and mindful contemplation. Meditative and introspective, this phase is a metaphorical catalyst for transformation, whereby energy is harnessed and directed towards a higher purpose.

> [!IDEA]
> Many adherents argue that the Crystals phase is synonymous with "Death" or "Change", seeing the phase as a representation of the end of a life cycle and the beginning of another. In this context, "Death" signifies not just the physical cessation of life but a deeper metaphorical connotation, reflecting the transformative nature of shedding the old self and embracing renewal.

> This alternative interpretation bolsters the idea that the Crystals phase serves as a catalyst, marking the crucial turning point in the Seven Phases cycle. It underscores the inherent volatility of existence, promoting the notion that metamorphosis and impermanence are critical components of the cycles of life and Reality itself.

>Within the teachings of the Milkwalker Cult, the Crystals phase takes on multidimensional significance. Whether regarded as untapped potential and energy transformation, or as "Death" and "Change", the Crystals phase encapsulates the complex tapestry of existence and embodies the deeper philosophical underpinnings of the cult's belief system.


4. **Pain**: This phase highlights the inevitability of suffering and adversity as a part of one’s life path. It teaches followers that enduring hardship and anguish refines one's character and imparts wisdom to overcome obstacles.

5. **Loss**: As a reminder of the impermanence of life and the illusory nature of attachments, this phase implores the acceptance of loss and its role in fostering a deeper connection with oneself, others, and the universe.

6. **Detachment**: Encouraging severing ties with material and emotional desires, this phase advocates for establishing an emotional equilibrium through the practice of letting go of worldly attachments. Supporting spiritual ascendance, detachment liberates one from the constraints of corporeal existence.

7. **Revelation**: The final and most transformative phase, Revelation signifies achieving enlightenment and divine understanding. It is the culmination of the lessons learned throughout the previous phases, allowing for transcendence beyond the confines of the physical world.

The Milkwalker Cult believes that the Seven Phases underpin the cosmological cycles and hold the key to the prophecy's fulfilment. By embracing and understanding these phases, the cult seeks to unshackle themselves from the constraints of linear time and flawed existence, ultimately pursuing the utopian incarnation of Reality they believe lies in the cataclysmic change initiated by the prophecy of [[Narrative/Concepts/Folklore/The Parallel Descendants\|the Parallel Descendants]].

Upon discovering the truth about the role of the Atwood sisters and their connection to the prophecy, the cult embarks on a perilous mission: to hunt down and eventually eliminate the sisters, with the ultimate aim of triggering the cataclysmic change that will fulfil the prophecy. The Milkwalker Cult, now actively seeking the Atwood sisters for their misguided altruistic (or sinister) motivations, becomes a significant threat to the safety and stability of the universe, as well as to the sisters themselves.

Obsessed with the impractical ideal of a utopian incarnation of Reality, this relentless pursuit by the cult inadvertently accelerates the very entropy they initially sought to undo, bringing the universe closer to the precipice of instability and collapse. As such, the Milkwalker Cult serves not only as a cautionary tale about the unforeseen consequences of blind faith and dogma but also exemplifies the delicate balance that exists within Reality – a balance disturbed by the introduction of deterministic ripples born out of misguided intents.
