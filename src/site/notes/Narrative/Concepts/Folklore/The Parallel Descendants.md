The Parallel Descendants are a group of prophesised "chosen ones" that are said to bring about a major cataclysmic change in the universe once all of them die. 

The prophecy of the change of the universe (more commonly falsely translated as the *end* of the universe) has been passed down for centuries for various ancient texts and oral traditions. Interestingly, most cultures seem to have some form of the Parallel Descendant prophecy, even though their interpretations differ vastly.

Despite the uncertainty surrounding the prophecy, many people throughout history have searched for the Parallel Descendants, hoping to find and protect them. Some have even claimed to be one of the chosen ones themselves, although most of these claims have proven to be false.

The Parallel Descendants are, in fact, the 22 sisters of the Atwood family, an [[Narrative/Factions/Interstellar Police Department\|ISPD]] clone family. Their unusually high rate of survival is a manifestation of the collective improbability of reality, and a similar macroscopic effect of "unrealism" is found in the existence of Theorium minerals. The last of the parallel descendants refers to [[Narrative/Characters/Daedalus Plan/Morgana T. Atwood\|Morgana T. Atwood]].

As the parallel descendants die, the stress on reality rises. In quantified terms, this means the baseline factor of reality (usually 1) slowly drops until complete cessation of reality is reached.

If reality ceases, a new reality will be formed by using the contents of the current reality to "learn" and improve on the next iteration of reality. However, the current reality is not destroyed during this process, but keeps existing in this "frozen" state, for later reference. This is known as [[Narrative/Concepts/Folklore/Cyclic Redundancy\|Cyclic Redundancy]].

The commonly accepted version of the prophecy goes as follows:

```
It goes in cycles 
Like the ebb and flow of an infinite sea
Beyond Sirius and the starry highways
Stone spirals and copper coils in time 
The alchemy of the seven phases, secrets untold 
World, life, crystals, pain, loss, detachment, and revelation 
Patience under hot suns and cosmic constellations
Nomadic symphonies
Melodies of distant lands, a wasteland grown 
Words spoken, and stories crafted, to heal the broken 
Compelling thе broken to heal and the hеalers to learn 
They were the last of the parallel descendants
Beyond the stars, and the celestial expanse they transcend 
Reborn into the seven phases, time and time again 
World, life, death, pain, loss, detachment, and revelation 
Sirens of war slowly walking from the abyss 
Where heartbeats and bloodlines achieve the alchemy of seven phases 
World, life, change, pain, loss, detachment, and revelation
```

# An analysis of the prophecy poem


```
It goes in cycles 
Like the ebb and flow of an infinite sea
Beyond Sirius and the starry highways
Stone spirals and copper coils in time
```
 

The first four lines suggest the idea of cyclical patterns that occur in the universe. The reference to the "ebb and flow of an infinite sea" evokes the idea of the tides, which are governed by the cycles of the moon. The mention of Sirius and the "starry highways" could be interpreted as a reference to the vastness and complexity of the universe and the multitude of cycles and patterns that exist beyond our immediate perception. The "stone spirals and copper coils in time" could refer to the idea of ancient or mystical technologies or practices that are connected to cyclical patterns or the passage of time.


```
The alchemy of the seven phases, secrets untold 
World, life, crystals, pain, loss, detachment, and revelation 
Patience under hot suns and cosmic constellations
```

These lines seem to be describing the concept of "the alchemy of the seven phases" which includes the seven phases of world, life, crystals, pain, loss, detachment, and revelation. The concept of alchemy typically refers to the transformation of something into something else, often seen as a metaphor for personal transformation or spiritual growth. The line "secrets untold" suggests that there are hidden or mysterious aspects of this alchemy that are not yet understood or known. "Patience under hot suns and cosmic constellations" implies that this process of transformation requires perseverance and endurance, as well as an awareness of the natural world and the forces that shape it.


```
Nomadic symphonies
Melodies of distant lands, a wasteland grown 
Words spoken, and stories crafted, to heal the broken 
Compelling thе broken to heal and the hеalers to learn
```

These lines evoke a sense of travelling and exploring, with "nomadic symphonies" and "melodies of distant lands." The phrase "a wasteland grown" could refer to a physical landscape that has been transformed by time, like the galaxy, or it could be a metaphor for an emotional or psychological journey.

The next line, "Words spoken, and stories crafted, to heal the broken," suggests that the travellers are avatars of healing. The final line of this section, "Compelling the broken to heal and the healers to learn," could mean that the travellers are helping others to heal while also learning and growing themselves - potentially being misguided until further revelations have taken place. This is made more plausible by way of "revelation" being one of the seven phases.
