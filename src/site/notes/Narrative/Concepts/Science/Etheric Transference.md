From a historical perspective, the defunct concept of **Etheric Transference**, championed by scholars in the early days of interstellar exploration, is often compared to the [[Narrative/Concepts/History/Ruinous Objects\|ruinous]] misconception of phlogiston in terms of its eventual dissolution in the face of better scientific theories.

Etheric Transference operated on the proposition that a universal medium, the ‘Ether’, permeated the entirety of space. This medium was postulated to be a pliable, malleable substance subjected to the influences of the so-called ‘Ether Shapers’, devices powered by various energy sources, including the pre-refinement phase of [[Narrative/Concepts/Science/Theodyne\|Theodyne]], [[Narrative/Concepts/Science/Theorium\|Theorium]].

According to this school of thought, a ship equipped with an Ether Shaper could mould the Ether around it to create a favourable environment for accelerated travel. Activation of the Ether Shaper reportedly distorted the Etheric medium, contracting it in front of the ship and expanding it behind, thus generating an effect of motion. This distortion was theorised to permit faster-than-light travel, a notion melodramatically dubbed ‘swimming through the Ether’.

Supposedly, the sophistication of the Ether Shapers determined the degree of Etheric manipulation, with more advanced Shapers allowing for faster travel speeds.

However, this theory fell into disrepute as advancements in [[Narrative/Concepts/Science/Applied Reality Theory\|Applied Reality Theory]] showcased the manipulation of fundamental constants, offering a far more pragmatic explanation for faster-than-light travel. The Etheric Transference theory, unable to explain these advances and refuted by the principles of [[Narrative/Concepts/Science/Applied Reality Theory\|Realistics]], was eventually discarded, deemed as speculative and unsubstantiated as the fallacious theory of phlogiston once was.
