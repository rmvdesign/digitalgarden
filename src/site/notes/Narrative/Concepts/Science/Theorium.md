Theorium is an exotic, iridescent, and translucent crystalline material with the extraordinary ability to manipulate the fabric of reality itself. First discovered by physicist [[Narrative/Characters/WB Characters/Theo Rose\|Theodore Rose]] from the Tallis Institute, Theorium has revolutionised the fields of science, technology, and exploration in the cosmos. This powerful substance has the potential to reshape the physical constants of reality, providing its users with seemingly god-like powers over creation. However, it is important to note that Theorium, in its raw and unrefined state, is highly unstable and can have dangerous effects on gravity and spacetime.

## Origin and Discovery

In a universe created by random chance, the emergence of life sent deterministic ripples, known as coherence waves, throughout spacetime. As these coherence waves collided and intertwined, they created the exotic material known as Theorium. [[Narrative/Characters/WB Characters/Theo Rose\|Theodore Rose]], a physicist at the prestigious Tallis Institute, first discovered this enigmatic crystal and recognised its potential to reshape the understanding of reality.

## Properties and Characteristics

Theorium is a crystalline substance with a structure similar to bismuth. Its iridescent and translucent properties make it visually stunning, but it is its ability to manipulate reality that sets it apart from other materials. In its raw state, Theorium is highly unstable and can cause disruptions in gravity and spacetime. This makes the mining and handling of Theorium a dangerous endeavour, reserved only for highly skilled professionals with specialised equipment.

## Refinement into [[Narrative/Concepts/Science/Theodyne\|Theodyne]]

[[Narrative/Characters/WB Characters/Theo Rose\|Theodore Rose]] developed a process to refine raw Theorium into a potent fuel known as [[Narrative/Concepts/Science/Theodyne\|Theodyne]]. When diluted, [[Narrative/Concepts/Science/Theodyne\|Theodyne]] serves as an exceptional energy source for cold fusion, powering starships and remote installations where renewable resources are scarce. In its purest form, [[Narrative/Concepts/Science/Theodyne\|Theodyne]]-100, the substance can generate coherence fields, which allow for the alteration of reality's fundamental constants.

## [[Narrative/Concepts/Science/Applied Reality Theory\|Applied Reality Theory]] and Realistics

The study and application of Theorium and [[Narrative/Concepts/Science/Theodyne\|Theodyne]]-100 led to the development of a new scientific discipline known as [[Narrative/Concepts/Science/Applied Reality Theory\|Applied Reality Theory]], or Realistics. This field explores the myriad possibilities offered by [[Narrative/Concepts/Science/Theodyne\|Theodyne]]-100 and its ability to bend the rules of reality. Among its most remarkable applications is the advent of faster-than-light (FTL) travel, which is achieved by temporarily increasing the speed of light within coherence fields.

## Applications

Beyond FTL travel, Theorium and [[Narrative/Concepts/Science/Theodyne\|Theodyne]]-100 have numerous applications in fields such as advanced materials engineering, gravity manipulation, and the control of fundamental forces like electromagnetism and nuclear forces. These breakthroughs have led to the development of unprecedented technologies that have reshaped every aspect of galactic society, including medicine, agriculture, communication, and transportation.

## Regulation and Control

With the power to reshape reality comes the potential for catastrophic consequences. As such, the control and regulation of Theorium and [[Narrative/Concepts/Science/Theodyne\|Theodyne]]-100 have become pressing concerns for governments and organisations across the galaxy. Strict laws have been put into place to monitor and manage the distribution of Theorium, and the Tallis Institute has emerged as the premier authority on Realistics, guiding its responsible application and ensuring that its knowledge and power do not fall into malevolent hands.
