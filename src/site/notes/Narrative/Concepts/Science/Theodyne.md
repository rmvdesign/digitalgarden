Theodyne is a potent fuel derived from the exotic and mysterious material [[Narrative/Concepts/Science/Theorium\|Theorium]], refined through a process developed by physicist [[Narrative/Characters/WB Characters/Theo Rose\|Theodore Rose]] of the Tallis Institute. With the ability to generate coherence fields that alter reality's fundamental constants, Theodyne has revolutionised the fields of science, technology, and exploration in the cosmos. In its purest form, Theodyne-100, the substance has enabled groundbreaking applications such as faster-than-light (FTL) travel and gravity manipulation.

## Refinement Process

The refinement process, developed by [[Narrative/Characters/WB Characters/Theo Rose\|Theodore Rose]], transforms raw and unstable [[Narrative/Concepts/Science/Theorium\|Theorium]] into the more controlled and useful substance Theodyne. The process involves a series of chemical and physical treatments that extracts and stabilises the reality-warping properties of [[Narrative/Concepts/Science/Theorium\|Theorium]], while also converting it into a fuel that can be used in various applications.

## Theodyne Variants

There are several variants of Theodyne, each with its own unique properties, applications, and levels of purity. The most commonly used form, Theodyne-D (diluted), is employed as an energy source for cold fusion, powering starships and remote installations where renewable resources are scarce. Theodyne-100, the purest form of Theodyne, is capable of generating coherence fields that allow for the manipulation of reality's fundamental constants.

## Applications

### FTL Travel

Theodyne-100 has enabled the development of faster-than-light (FTL) travel by generating coherence fields in which the speed of light is temporarily increased. This allows spacecraft to traverse vast interstellar distances without violating the universal light-speed limit, transforming space exploration and interstellar travel.

### Advanced Materials Engineering

The reality-altering properties of Theodyne-100 have been harnessed to create materials with extraordinary properties, such as super-strong alloys and self-repairing structures, leading to advancements in architecture, transportation, and defence technologies.

### Energy Production

In its diluted form, Theodyne-D, usually sold in purity grades of 5-20% (Td-5, Td-10, Td-15, Td-20), serves as an exceptional energy source for cold fusion, providing an efficient and powerful means of powering starships and remote installations.

## Regulation and Control

Given the potential for catastrophic consequences and misuse of Theodyne, particularly in its purest form, the control and regulation of Theodyne have become pressing concerns for governments and organisations across the galaxy. Strict laws have been put in place to monitor and manage the distribution of Theodyne, and the Tallis Institute has emerged as the premier authority on the responsible application and control of this powerful substance.

## Environmental Impact

While Theodyne has revolutionised energy production and transportation, concerns have been raised about its potential environmental impact. The refinement process produces waste materials that must be handled with care to avoid contamination and damage to ecosystems. Additionally, the manipulation of fundamental constants, if not properly controlled, could have unforeseen consequences on the fabric of spacetime and the stability of the universe. As such, research is ongoing to develop sustainable and environmentally responsible methods of Theodyne production and use.
