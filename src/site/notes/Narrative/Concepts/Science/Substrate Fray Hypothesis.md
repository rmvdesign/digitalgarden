The **Substrate Fray Hypothesis** is a theoretical proposition suggesting that the application of [[Narrative/Concepts/Tech/Realistics Drive\|Realistics Drive]], predicated on the manipulation of fundamental constants, may incur unanticipated damage to the basic structure of reality.

Although initially the usage of [[Narrative/Concepts/Science/Applied Reality Theory\|Realistics]] technology for interstellar travel and other applications was celebrated, it was not long before a subset of physicists began voicing concerns about the possible repercussions of meddling with Reality’s backbone. These anxieties coalesced into the Substrate Fray Hypothesis.

According to this theory, the Reality construct behaves like a piece of fabric and the application of [[Narrative/Concepts/Science/Applied Reality Theory\|Realistics]] is parallel to the stretching and contracting of this cosmic cloth. While initially, the ‘fabric’ seems to regain its normal state post these manipulations, a prolonged and repeated use of this technology is purported to cause the ‘weft and warp’ of this interstellar fabric to weaken and fray.

As a result, ‘Reality pockets’ could potentially start to emerge, regions of the universe where the fundamental constants are permanently altered. Predicted effects of these pockets could range from subtle alterations, such as changes in the speed of light or slight deviations from the normal laws of physics, to far more catastrophic ones such as sudden matter disintegration, the emergence of unpredictable destructive forces, or uncontrolled production of energy threatening to destabilise surrounding regions of space.
