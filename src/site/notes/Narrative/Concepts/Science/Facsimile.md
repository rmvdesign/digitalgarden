**Facsimiles** (𐑓𐑨𐑒𐑕𐑦𐑥𐑩𐑤𐑰) are a class of analogue computers that were widely used in the galaxy for various applications, including calculating flight trajectories and performing meteorological forecasts. The most prominent and advanced versions of these devices were the Astrosimiles, which played a crucial role in the early stages of space exploration and colonisation. With the discovery of digital computing technology among the [[Narrative/Concepts/History/Death of Earth\|ruins of Earth]], Facsimiles evolved into hybrid systems called Digisimiles, which revolutionised space travel and exploration.

## History

The development of Facsimiles in the galaxy predates the discovery of digital computing technology. These intricate mechanical devices relied on gears, levers, and other moving parts to perform complex calculations. As spaceflight became more common, the need arose for even more powerful analogue computers to navigate the vast expanse of space. Thus, the Astrosimiles were born.

Astrosimiles were massive, occupying entire rooms or even buildings, and meticulously crafted with the utmost precision. They were considered marvels of engineering and played a crucial role in the advancement of space exploration. The engineers and technicians who designed, built, and maintained the Astrosimiles were highly respected within their society, as they were responsible for ensuring the safety and success of space missions.

During the Navarean golden ages, Navareo V had the most advanced Astrosimiles, contributing to its dominance in space exploration and colonisation. V's Astrosimiles were housed in massive, fortress-like structures called Astrocitadels, which also served as hubs for space missions and government-sponsored research.

Tallisite Facsimiles were usually the centre of a settlement, being used by the scholars and elders of a town or village. Their implementations, however, focused on the movement of planets and were extremely accurate meteorological instruments, being able to forecast winds, air pressure, rainstorms, temperatures, and other climate factors with high precision.

## Integration of Digital Technology

The discovery of silicon semiconductors and digital computing technology among the ruins of Earth marked a turning point in the galaxy's history. Initially, the process of integrating digital computing into existing technology was met with resistance, as traditionalists clung to the tried-and-true methods of the Astrosimiles. However, the potential of digital computing could not be ignored, and a new generation of scientists and engineers began to study the unearthed artefacts from Earth, reverse-engineering their technology and gradually incorporating it into their own society.

The fusion of digital and analogue technologies led to the creation of hybrid systems that combined the best of both worlds. The precision and mechanical beauty of the Astrosimiles were blended with the processing power and speed of digital computers, resulting in a new class of machines that revolutionised space travel and exploration. These hybrid systems, known as Digisimiles, became the new standard for calculating flight trajectories, allowing for even more ambitious space missions.

## Legacy

The integration of digital computing into the galaxy's existing technology forever changed the course of its history, transforming its understanding of space travel and expanding its horizons beyond the limitations of the analogue era. The legacy of the Astrosimiles and the wisdom of Earth's ancient civilisation served as a foundation for progress, inspiring countless generations to reach for the stars and explore the universe with a newfound sense of wonder and possibility.

The pursuit of digital technology became a unifying force in the galaxy, leading to the establishment of dedicated research facilities and academies where scholars studied the relics of Earth and pushed the boundaries of their own society's technological capabilities. The Astrosimiles and their successors, the Digisimiles, are celebrated as symbols of innovation and determination in the face of seemingly insurmountable challenges.

## In Popular Culture

The Astrosimiles and their role in the early stages of space exploration have been romanticised in various forms of media throughout the galaxy. They have become iconic symbols of a bygone era, often featured in science fiction novels, films, and television series as the backdrop for tales of adventure and discovery. In some cases, the Astrosimiles have even been personified as wise, ancient beings that guide explorers and engineers on their journeys, further cementing their status as a cherished part of the galaxy's cultural heritage.

## Preservation and Museums

As digital technology continued to advance, many Astrosimiles were decommissioned and replaced by more advanced digital systems. However, their historical and cultural significance has not been forgotten. Several Astrosimiles have been carefully preserved and restored, and can now be found on display in museums and galleries across the galaxy. These exhibits offer a glimpse into the early days of space travel and serve as a testament to the ingenuity of the engineers who created them.

Visitors to these museums can marvel at the intricate mechanical components of the Astrosimiles and learn about their role in shaping the galaxy's history. Interactive exhibits allow individuals to experience the unique challenges faced by early space explorers and gain an appreciation for the remarkable achievements made possible by these analogue computing pioneers.

## Conclusion

Facsimiles, and more specifically Astrosimiles, are an integral part of the galaxy's technological and cultural heritage. Their development and subsequent integration with digital technology from Earth laid the foundation for the modern era of space exploration and discovery. The legacy of these analogue computers continues to inspire future generations to push the boundaries of technology and seek out new horizons in the vast expanse of the cosmos.
