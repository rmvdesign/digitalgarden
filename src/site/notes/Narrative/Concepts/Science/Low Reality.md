In a state of **Low Reality**, the dominant paradigm of physics as we understand it begins to take on an increasingly surreal quality. This is characterised by the gradual erosion of typical cause-and-effect relationships, leading to a gradual shift toward consequences that do not align with our standard perception of reality.

Across low reality regions, objects and individuals may exhibit behaviours that starkly contradict established natural laws. For instance, physical injury, such as losing an arm, might not result in functional loss. The detached arm, guided by a form of phantom agency, may continue to behave as if it is attached, manipulating objects, and reacting to stimuli.

Furthermore, inanimate objects can take on incongruous characteristics. A commonly cited example involves rigid and brittle materials, such as plates, exhibiting elastic properties akin to rubber when subjected to force. Theoretically, these plates, when thrown forceful onto a hard surface, would not shatter but bounce back. 

The peculiar behaviours drastically escalate as the '[[Narrative/Concepts/Science/Applied Reality Theory\|factor of reality]]', meaning the collective divergence from the baseline values of the fundamental constants, further decreases. This quantitative measure reflects the degree to which the usual laws of physics have softened their grip on the world. The lower the factor, the greater the deviation from known physical laws, leading to increasingly erratic and anomalous experiences. 

# Examples of low reality

- **Reversing Waterfalls**: An enchanting geographic feature found only in low reality regions. The water in these waterfalls, when reaching the edge, ascends instead of falling as customary to our perception of gravity. The direction of water flow defies gravity, resulting in an upward cascade, presenting a visually mesmerising spectacle.

- **Immaterial Windows**: These are architectural anomalies that allow inhabitants to step into them and emerge from any other similar window within sight. Traditional physical barriers such as walls and distance bear no meaning, demonstrating non-local connectivity characteristic of quantum entanglement on a macroscopic scale.

- **Irresponsive Echo**: In certain valleys, one's voice may return as an echo uttering unrelated phrases or even fresh conversations. Subsequent echoes much later may then respond with the original shouted words, demonstrating a temporal anomalies exclusive to low reality regions.

- **Forgetful Shadows**: Found in places where the lighting has faded memory, the shadows of objects or beings can delay their response to the source's movement or, at times, exhibit entirely independent behaviours.

- **Deferred Pain**: Physical injury in Low Reality zones might not produce immediate discomfort. There could be a time lapse between the point of injury and the onset of corresponding pain, leading to a disconcerting disconnect between the cause and the effect.

- **Vegetative Vibrancy**: Plants may exhibit exaggerated responsiveness to sunlight, growing rapidly in response to small amounts of light. Flowers could bloom in a matter of minutes, trees could sprout fully in hours.

- **Incorrigible Wandering**: Individuals or objects in direct contact with the surfaces may randomly reorient themselves. Despite not moving, they may find that they've turned unnoticeably, facing a different direction than prior.
