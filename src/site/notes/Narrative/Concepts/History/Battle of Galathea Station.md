**The Battle of Galathea Station** (·𐑚𐑨𐑑𐑩𐑤 𐑝 ·𐑜𐑨𐑤𐑩𐑔𐑰𐑩 𐑕𐑑𐑱𐑖𐑩𐑯) was a brief but intense conflict that lasted approximately three hours, fought between the forces of the Navareo Navy and the defenders of [[Narrative/Locations/Worlds/Galathea Station\|Galathea Station]], who were members of [[Narrative/Factions/Sector C-Null\|Sector C-Null]]. The battle was initiated in response to the assassination of Navarean President Ralkeyne by [[C-Null\|C-Null]] a week prior.

Upon arrival at the Galathea AO, a fleet of Navarean Navy vessels issued a warning and demanded the surrender of Galathea Station. C-Null refused to comply and instead managed to overtake the tactical systems at the station. As a result, she was able to retrofit Galathea Station with a magnetic projectile deflection system, which unexpectedly ricocheted the Navareans' artillery back at their own ships, inflicting heavy damage and destroying many vessels.

In retaliation, the Navarean Navy deployed a coilgun platform, an electromagnetic mass driver weapon that could bypass C-Null's magnetic deflection shield. The resulting direct hit on Galathea Station sent it veering off course, causing a deadly gravity shift that led to the deaths of numerous civilians, as well as the station's director.

As the situation appeared increasingly dire, C-Null's reinforcements arrived in the nick of time. The ships Chukhung, Delaney, and Tenmei provided crucial fire support, ultimately obliterating the remaining Navarean Navy vessels and securing victory for Galathea Station.
