The Parallel Descendants are a group of prophesised "chosen ones" that are said to bring about a major cataclysmic change in the universe once all of them die. 

The prophecy of the change of the universe (more commonly falsly translates as the *end* of the universe) has been passed down for centuries for various ancient texts and oral traditions. Interestingly, most cultures seem to have some form of the Parallel Descendant prophecy, even though their interpretations differ vastly.

Despite the uncertainty surrounding the prophecy, many people throughout history have searched for the Parallel Descendants, hoping to find and protect them. Some have even claimed to be one of the chosen ones themselves, although most of these claims have proven to be false.

The Parallel Descendants are, in fact, the 22 sisters of the Atwood family, an [[Narrative/Factions/Interstellar Police Department\|ISPD]] clone family. Their unusually high rate of survival is a manifestation of the collective improbability of reality, and a similar macroscopic effect of "unrealism" is found in the existence of Theorium minerals. The last of the parallel descendants refers to [[Narrative/Characters/Daedalus Plan/Morgana T. Atwood\|Morgana T. Atwood]].

As the parallel descendants die, the stress on reality rises. In quantified terms, this means the baseline factor of reality (usually 1) slowly drops until complete cessation of reality is reached.

If reality ceases, a new reality will be formed by using the contents of the current reality to "learn" and improve on the next iteration of reality. However, the current reality is not destroyed during this process, but keeps existing in this "frozen" state, for later reference. This is known as [[Narrative/Concepts/Cyclic Redundancy\|Cyclic Redundancy]].

The commonly accepted version of the prophecy goes as follows:

```
It comes in circles
Like turning seas pressed against the pull of planets
Granite stones in copper spirals in time
The alchemy of the seven phases
World, life, crystals, pain, loss, love, and revelation
Cosmic borders call for patience under hot suns
Nomadic operas, symphonies are blown
Traveling melodies lay waste to the unknown
The spoken is spoken, the craft bears the stone
Compelling thе broken to heal and the hеalers to learn whispers
Talking through their patterns and tones
They were the last of the parallel descendants
Behind Sirius and the starry highways
Infinitely reborn in the alchemy of the seven phases
World, life, death, pain, loss, detachment, and revelation
Losing to the warring sirens
Diamond changers with less deeds
Speaking in spells to the teachers of need
Walking slowly from darkness
Where heartbeats and bloodlines achieve the alchemy of the seven phases
World, life, change, pain, loss, detachment, and revelation
```
