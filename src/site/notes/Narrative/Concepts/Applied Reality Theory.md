**Applied Reality Theory**, also known as **Realistics**, is a branch of theoretical physics that focuses on the manipulation of fundamental constants, the fundamental physical quantities that define the nature of the universe. It is based on the idea that these constants are not fixed, but can be altered through the application of certain stimuli.

One of the main applications of Applied Reality Theory is the development of the [[Narrative/Concepts/Tech/Realistics Drive\|Realistics Drive]], a method of faster-than-light (FTL) travel that works by temporarily altering the fundamental constants of reality within a "bubble" around a ship or individual. This allows them to effectively travel faster than the speed of light, despite the fact that the speed of light remains constant within the bubble.

The **Theodyne Reality Alteration Circuit (T-RAC)** uses a pure Theodyne-100 crystal, which allows it to manipulate the fundamental constants of reality, including the speed of light, the fundamental charge, the QCD scale, the strong interaction coefficient, the weak interaction coefficient, and the electron orbit radius. By altering these constants, the [[Narrative/Concepts/Tech/Realistics Drive\|Realistics Drive]] creates a region of altered reality around the ship or individual, allowing them to accelerate to FTL speeds without violating the laws of physics.

In addition to its application in FTL travel, Applied Reality Theory has also been used to develop other technologies, including advanced medical treatments, energy production, and materials engineering. However, the manipulation of fundamental constants is a complex and potentially dangerous field, and the full extent of its potential applications and risks is still not fully understood.

# Macroscopic effects

The effects of prolonged exposure to the altered reality created by a T-RAC device on test subjects have been the subject of much study and debate. In order to better understand these effects, a series of controlled experiments were conducted in which test subjects were exposed to the altered reality for extended periods of time. The results of these experiments are outlined in the following table.

It is important to note that the effects of the altered reality can vary widely from one test subject to another, and that the severity of the effects is largely dependent on the degree to which the fundamental constants are altered. As such, the table should be taken as a general guide rather than a definitive list of all possible effects.

| Constant | Minimum | 1/100 | 1/10 | 1x | 10x | 100x |

| $e$ Elementary charge | All electrical and electromagnetic activity ceases, even in electrets and permanent magnets | Neurochemical processes slow down considerably. Known as “reality drunkenness” | Electricity becomes inefficient by a factor of 10 | Baseline | Semiconductors burn out unless protected from power surges | Semiconductor technology is infeasible to use and burns out |
| $G$ Gravitational constant | Effects of gravity essentially negated. Only used in research contexts. Can’t be squeezed. | Effects of gravity significantly lowered.
