The **Interstellar Law Codex** (𐑦𐑯𐑑𐑼𐑕𐑑𐑧𐑤𐑼 𐑤𐑭 𐑒𐑴𐑛𐑧𐑒𐑕, ILC) is a canonical legal document authored and upheld by the _[[Narrative/Factions/Interstellar Police Department\|Interstellar Police Department]]_. It serves as the legal pillar in the vast, bustling expanse known as the **Neutral Zone**, a region dotted with multifarious lunar landscapes, churning nebulas, and cosmic thoroughfares, where species from across the galaxies converge, cohabitate, and interact.

The purpose of the ILC is multifold. It not only firmly establishes the rules of conduct within the Neutral Zone, preventing potential disorder, and laying guidelines for interspecies interactions, but also mitigates fiery disputes and cultivates harmony among a veritable cacophony of interstellar inhabitants.

The [[Narrative/Factions/Interstellar Police Department\|ISPD]] holds the dual role of being both the drafters and enforcers of the ILC. Valiantly maintaining peace within the Neutral Zone, they ensure that all inhabitants follow the laid codes irrespective of their planetary provenance, ensuring equality in justice. Disputes adjudication, reinforcement of order, deflection of underhanded tactics or cosmic transgressions— the [[Narrative/Factions/Interstellar Police Department\|ISPD]] performs it all, backed by the commanding authority of the Interstellar Law Codex.

The Codex itself is central to the [[Narrative/Factions/Interstellar Police Department\|ISPD]]'s operations. Long renowned for its comprehensive scope and intricate details, the ILC covers an astronomical number of issues, from minor civil infractions such as littering the space lanes, to major criminal activities such as illegal substance trade or piracy of space cargo. Its painstakingly-formulated legal provisions provide the robust framework for neutral and fair administration within the Neutral Zone.

It is pertinent to record that while the Codex itself is considered a paragon of interstellar jurisprudence, its effectiveness in execution relies heavily on the tenacity and resourcefulness of the [[Narrative/Factions/Interstellar Police Department\|ISPD]]. With their steadfast commitment to maintaining peace and order, the [[Narrative/Factions/Interstellar Police Department\|ISPD]] reverberatingly strikes the gavel of justice in the court of cosmic law, governed by the authoritative and universally respected Interstellar Law Codex.
