The HyperMetro is a galactic rapid transit system designed to connect homeworlds separated by thousands of light years. Utilising advanced faster-than-light (FTL) technology, it enables the economic viability of interstellar travel. The system comprises a network of automated HyperLanes, canals of space with altered physical constants that allow the HyperMetro Trains to accelerate to significantly higher speeds than the speed of light. The trains, which are also automated, run hourly and serve approximately 40 stations throughout the network.

The HyperMetro was developed by the Delta, an isolationist and xenophobic amphibian species with a highly caste-based society. Their homeworld, Delton, is also connected to the network. Most HyperMetro stations utilise a single platform for both directions of travel, although multiple platforms are available for different HyperMetro lines.

As trains enter the station, their compartments rotate 90 degrees to the side. This unique design allows trains to run vertically like a rocket, while the stations remain horizontal like traditional train stations. The trains are managed by automated systems, with a control hub at one of the termini on each line. Teams of three or four operators oversee the smooth operation of the lines.

The HyperMetro network consists of the following lines:

- **Navaryn Express (Blue)**: Varyn to New Tallis via Navareo
- **Rose Express (Burgundy)**: Maxwell to Light Fields Power Plant via Theotech TechLabs
- **A-Star (Grey)**: Circular line around the inner worlds of the galaxy, connecting Navareo, Maxwell, [[Narrative/Locations/Minor Worlds/Ixbalanque\|Ixbalanque]], and the Navarean colonies
- **Rapid Line (Red)**: Tethys to [[Narrative/Locations/Minor Worlds/Iris\|Iris]] via Tallis
- **Unity Line (Green)**: Lorem to Varyn via Tallis, with a planned extension to Theotech EdgeLabs
- **Ring Line (Pink)**: Circular line in the Ring Worlds, connecting Emac, Vel'xivv, and other Ring Worlds
- **Neutral Line (Orange)**: Delton to [[Narrative/Locations/Minor Worlds/Pulaski\|Pulaski]] via Navareo and Maxwell
