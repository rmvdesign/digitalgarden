**The Universal Language** (𐑞 𐑿𐑯𐑩𐑝𐑻𐑕𐑩𐑤 𐑤𐑨𐑙𐑜𐑢𐑦𐑡) or just **Universal** (𐑿𐑯𐑩𐑝𐑻𐑕𐑩𐑤), as it is colloquially known across the galaxy, represents the linguistic medium predominantly utilised by interstellar citizens for communication. Its foundations rest upon the ruins of Earth—a now-defunct planet that perished in the century -4—and it remarkably retains the syntax, grammar, and extensive vocabulary of what was historically known as English. The Universal Language spoken by most citizens of the galaxy is a mostly unmodified version of the [[Narrative/Concepts/History/Ruinous Objects\|Ruinous]] language English, spoken by around 2.7 billion humans at its height.

Currently, Universal is the official language of the World Unity, as well as among the official languages of several minor worlds. It is estimated that about 82% of galactic citizens capable of communication have some grasp of the Universal language.
# Writing system

As the original writing system ("Latin") English had been historically used with proved to be simultaneously too complex and too simple for everyday use. Among the complaints cited by the Tallis Institute of Ruinous Sciences were unnecessary reduplication of consonants, unclear vowel values and a general lack of cohesion in the alphabet's design. Instead, the **Universal Alphabet** - based on the [[Narrative/Concepts/History/Ruinous Objects\|ruinous]] invention of Shavian - was chosen. The Universal Alphabet has a single letter per phonemic value, with ligatures being provided for convenience's sake. Some letters can stand on their own as logograms, standing in for a common word like "the" or "with" as "𐑞" and "𐑢" respectively.
