**Galactic Standard Time (GST)** is a widely-adopted, uniform system of time measurement developed in response to the rapid dissemination of information across the galaxy after the complete decryption of the [[Narrative/Concepts/History/Martian Backup\|Martian Backup]]. With numerous species and cultures using different methods of timekeeping, the need for a standardised time system became apparent to maintain efficient communication, trade, and cooperation between various galactic factions.

Inspired by the terraformation of the planet [[Narrative/Locations/Worlds/Hora\|Hora]], Yalgeth Labs devised a new time system based on [[Narrative/Locations/Worlds/Hora\|Hora]]'s unique orbital characteristics. The planet was deliberately shaped and positioned in orbit to facilitate accurate time measurement according to the following specifications:

- 1 day on [[Narrative/Locations/Worlds/Hora\|Hora]] consists of 10 hours
- 1 hour is divided into 100 minutes
- 1 minute is composed of 100 seconds
- A full orbit of [[Narrative/Locations/Worlds/Hora\|Hora]] around its star takes 400 days

Galactic Standard Time proved to be a successful solution to the issues arising from fragmented timekeeping across the galaxy. Today, it serves as a foundation for synchronised activities, events and, ultimately, the unity between diverse galactic civilisations. Its widespread adoption is a testament to the lasting impact of Human knowledge and the increasing interconnectedness of the galaxy's inhabitants.
