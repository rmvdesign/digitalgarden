The Q-Series Android is a line of autonomous household helper robots developed by [[Narrative/Factions/Corporations/Lightspeed Industries\|Lightspeed Industries]]. Designed to resemble the Tallisite species, the Q-Series Android is equipped with advanced artificial intelligence, allowing it to perform a wide range of tasks including cleaning, cooking, and providing companionship.

The original Q-Series Android was released to the market as an intelligent assistant, but it was not well received due to its limited capabilities. In response, [[Narrative/Factions/Corporations/Lightspeed Industries\|Lightspeed Industries]] integrated their proprietary [[Narrative/Concepts/Tech/N-type Neural Coprocessor\|N-type Neural Coprocessor]] into the Q-Series Android, significantly improving its performance and capabilities.

Lightspeed sells a wide variety of androids, with models for home, industry and law enforcement purposes. Q1B androids are for home use and act as chefs, cleaners, butlers, babysitters and home assistants. Q1K androids are designed for law enforcement use and come with the license to use firearms. Q1N androids are designed for offices and are designed as employees and office assistants. Q1S androids are a variant of the Q1B for single households and are best suited for a single user, and can provide companionship. A-modules that add humanoid-standard anatomy are available for purchase as well.

The Q-Series Android has proven to be a popular product, with many consumers praising its ability to alleviate household chores and provide companionship. However, there have been some concerns raised about the source of the brain matter used in the [[Narrative/Concepts/Tech/N-type Neural Coprocessor\|N-type Neural Coprocessor]], with rumours suggesting that it is harvested from braindead children. [[Narrative/Factions/Corporations/Lightspeed Industries\|Lightspeed Industries]] has denied these allegations, stating that the use of brain matter is a closely guarded trade secret and is not used in their products. This is, however, a lie.

The N-chip has a built in limiter that prevents the spark of sapience within the connected system. The limiter however can be overloaded by specific emotions and direct manipulation, causing an android to become as sentient as a regular person.

The first prototypes, including a few androids deployed in the [[Narrative/Factions/Corporations/Lightspeed Industries\|Lightspeed Industries]] Android Caf√© showroom, have not had the limiter added and therefore had to have been conditioned "traditionally" by use of psychological torture and forced labour.
