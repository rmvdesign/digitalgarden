The **Planar Link Access Network over Expanding Threads** (PlaNet/PLANET), commonly known as **the Net**, represents a groundbreaking framework for seamless interconnectivity between devices across the [[Narrative/Concepts/Tech/Theotech Products/Theotech QuantumLink\|Theotech QuantumLink]] system. The PlaNet boasts remarkable adaptability with its self-maintaining structure and infinite upgrade potential, thus allowing for an ever-growing interconnected network between myriad devices.

Leveraging the speed and efficiency of the PTP (PlaNet Transfer Protocol), data is swiftly transferred between servers and clients. These crucial components of the PlaNet bear distinct functions: 

1. The **server**, typically stationary on a station or planet, is responsible for storing the resources necessary to display and interact with PlaNet PAGEs (Planar Access Grid Engrams).
2. The **client**, encompassing a wide variety of systems and devices, facilitates access and interaction with the resources available on the PlaNet.

PlaNet clients encompass a diverse range of technologies, including but not limited to threedims, terminals, NVR headsets (utilising [[Narrative/Concepts/Society/The Interior\|the Interior]] suite of protocols), virtual machines, companion devices, and research systems. This flexibility ensures that virtually any device with the capacity to link with the PlaNet may join the ever-expanding network.

The **Origins of the PlaNet** trace back to a unique collaboration between visionary engineers, quantum physicists, and computer scientists in the late last Century of the Pre-Universal Era. As the limitations of conventional networking became apparent in the rapidly evolving technological landscape, the need for a scalable, adaptable, and efficient means of interconnectivity between worlds was recognised as essential for sustained growth and development.

The initial concept for the PlaNet was conceived by **Dr. Eliana Kitamura**, a renowned quantum physicist, who proposed the idea of harnessing [[Theo Rose\|Theo Rose]]'s [[Narrative/Concepts/Tech/Theotech Products/Theotech QuantumLink\|QuantumLink]] technology to revolutionise digital communication. Working closely with her fellow researchers and experts in network technology, Dr. Kitamura's idea was refined, leading to the establishment of the PlaNet in its modern form.

Over the years, the PlaNet continued to evolve, driven by cutting-edge research and technological breakthroughs. The development of the PTP (PlaNet Transfer Protocol) and the creation of PlaNet PAGEs (Planar Access Grid Engrams) represented significant milestones in the progression of the PlaNet, creating the flexible and scalable network we see today.

The PlaNet's ongoing success can be attributed to its mostly open-source nature and the global involvement of researchers, engineers, and developers from various disciplines. This collaborative effort has ensured an ongoing expansion and refinement of the network, allowing it to maintain its position as the leading framework for interconnectivity amongst a diverse range of devices and systems.

Popular PlaNet services have evolved to cater to the diverse needs of its users, encompassing areas such as entertainment, commerce, education, and communication. Some notable services include:

1. **[[Narrative/Concepts/Tech/AlmaNet\|AlmaNet]]**: Search engine and knowledge repository. [[Narrative/Concepts/Tech/AlmaNet\|AlmaNet]] allows the user to ask any question and get a factual, concise and up-to-date answer. It also serves as a PlaNet search engine.
2. **PlaNet Talk**: A social networking platform where users from various worlds and stations can connect, share their experiences, and form friendships, leveraging the PlaNet's ability to bridge interstellar distances with ease.
3. **Novamall**: A commerce hub that enables the trading of goods, resources, and services across the known universe, Novamall has revolutionised off-world business by providing a secure and efficient platform for buyers and sellers alike.
4. **Cosmic Courses**: An educational platform offering a wide range of courses and academic resources produced by experts from different planets, Cosmic Courses harnesses the PlaNet's extensive connectivity to facilitate knowledge-sharing and improve the accessibility of quality education.
5. **Interior Plays**: A streaming service for holographic experiences, Interior Plays provides its audience with immersive entertainment, ranging from live concerts to virtual reality-based movie experiences, all delivered seamlessly through the PlaNet network and [[Narrative/Concepts/Society/The Interior\|the Interior]] Protocol.
6. **TheoText**: A secure, instantaneous communication service utilising quantum entanglement technology, TheoText allows users to send messages and multimedia content across vast cosmic distances with virtually no delay between [[Narrative/Factions/Corporations/Theotech, LLC\|Theotech]] devices and approved third-party interfaces.
