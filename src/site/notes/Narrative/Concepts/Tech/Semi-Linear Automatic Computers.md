**Semi-Linear Automatic Computers** (SLACs, often just called **computers**) are an advanced class of computational devices that ingeniously amalgamate digital and analogue technologies. Rising to prominence subsequent to the exposition of silicon semiconductor technologies, these machines differentiate themselves from the standard digital computers through their non-traditional storage and data organisation methods.

Slipping away from the conventional byte-oriented block device approach, SLCs store data utilising a specialised storage medium known as [[Narrative/Concepts/Tech/Magnetic Autotape\|Magnetic Autotape]]. This groundbreaking data storage medium affords the uncommon characteristic of retaining both digital and analogue signals on a singular tape concurrently. SLCs equipped with an analogue converter can also store [[Narrative/Concepts/Science/Facsimile\|Facsimile]] data on [[Narrative/Concepts/Tech/Magnetic Autotape\|Autotape]].

Instead of the conventional data unit known as Bytes, in an SLC, data is organised in variable-length units referred to as Words. Unlike the byte, a Word's length is not fixed and can oscillate within the boundaries of a single file, enabling intricate and dynamic data representation.

Data in SLCs is not stored or retrieved via conventional sector-based access, but rather linearly, making them semi-linear in nature. This unique interplay of digital precision and analogue flexibility provides for a robust platform for complex calculations and simulations, especially in resource-intensive sectors such as physics, weather forecasting, and artificial intelligence research.

SLCs do come with their own unique advantages and challenges. The vastly flexible data storage and access methods enable a representation and retrieval of information that is not confined by conventional digital limits. However, this also presents challenges in creating algorithms and programming languages that can effectively exploit these benefits while mitigating inherent difficulties posed by the variable-length Words and nonlinear data access methods.
