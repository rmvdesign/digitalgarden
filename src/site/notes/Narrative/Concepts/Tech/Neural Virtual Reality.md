**Neural Virtual Reality** (𐑧𐑯𐑝𐑰𐑸), also known as **NVR**, is a technology that allows users to fully immerse themselves in a virtual reality environment by directly stimulating the nerves in their body. An NVR headset consists of a headband with electrodes that read the user's nerve activity and two laser arrays that send information directly into the brain via hyper-precise laser pulses to the optic nerve.

The technology behind NVR has been in development for decades, but it has only recently become widely available to the general public. The first NVR systems used electrodes on the scalp to read brain activity and deep brain stimulation to provide feedback to the user, but these systems were limited in their capabilities and often caused discomfort for the user.

The current generation of NVR systems utilises a headband with electrodes that are placed directly on the skin, allowing for much more precise readings of the user's nerve activity. This, combined with the use of laser pulses to directly stimulate the optic nerve, allows for a much more immersive and realistic virtual reality experience.

Using NVR requires the use of a specialised headset that is equipped with electrodes to read nerve activity and lasers to stimulate the optic nerve. When the headset is activated, the user will enter a dreamless sleep-like state as the headset temporarily paralyses the user, inhibiting motor function. This is required to prevent the user from accidentally moving their eyes and breaking the laser line, as well as preventing accidental harm from involuntary movements.

The process of using NVR involves the user donning the headset and activating it through a simple command or gesture. Once the headset is activated, the user will begin to feel the effects of the NVR as the electrodes and lasers work to inhibit motor function and stimulate the optic nerve. The user will then be able to fully experience the virtual reality environment as if it were real, with all of their senses fully engaged. Simulation fidelity is determined by the amount and quality of the electrodes used, as well as the focus and quality of the lenses.

However, prolonged abuse of NVR can lead to a condition known as NVR addiction. This occurs when individuals become overly reliant on the technology and are unable to function without it. NVR addiction can lead to a wide range of negative consequences, including fatigue, eye pain, and even blindness in rare cases. Additionally, the constant use of NVR can scar the optic nerve, leading to a condition called luminal photophobic allodynia, in which the individual experiences pain in response to bright light that would normally not cause pain.
