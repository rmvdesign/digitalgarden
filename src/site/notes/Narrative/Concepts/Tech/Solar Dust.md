**Solar Dust** is a type of photovoltaic material used in advanced solar power generation systems. Comprising such systems as high-performance solar collectors and semiconductor-based solar panels, Solar Dust is a result of refinement and augmentation of naturally occurring substances.

Initially sourced in its raw form from the belts of [[Narrative/Locations/Worlds/Alden\|Alden]], the material is subject to rigorous refinement processes. These processes aim to extract and enhance the inherent photo-reactive qualities of the dust. Following successful refinement, Solar Dust exemplifies a heightened capacity for power generation when compared to traditional photovoltaic materials.

A significant characteristic of Solar Dust is its fine particulate composition. This granular structure permits a dispersed spread of the material, effectively increasing the surface area that can absorb and convert solar radiation into electrical energy.

With the introduction of semiconductors in power generation technology, the utility of Solar Dust saw a considerable advancement. Combined with semiconductor substrates, Solar Dust forms integral layers in solar panels, achieving a considerable increase in energy conversion efficiency.

Currently, Solar Dust farms, especially those established on planets in close proximity to their stars, are a popular implementation of this technology. Solar Dust continues to contribute significantly to the progress of solar power generation methodologies.
