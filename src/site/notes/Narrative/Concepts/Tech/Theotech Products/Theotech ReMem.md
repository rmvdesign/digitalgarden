**[[Narrative/Factions/Theotech, LLC\|Theotech]] ReMem** is a piece of NVR technology developed by [[Narrative/Factions/Theotech, LLC\|Theotech]]. It allows users to access and reconstruct their memories in real-time, providing a highly immersive and interactive VR experience.

ReMem works by recording the brain activity of the user as they actively recall their memories. This data is then used to reconstruct the memories in a virtual space, allowing the user to relive their past experiences as if they were happening in the present.

Compared to other modes of memory recording and transcription, ReMem has comparably low fidelity and is distinct from source recording technologies such as Blackbox Implants. ReMem best practice is to record a recent memory, as older memories will be significantly harder to reconstruct and are prone to artifacting. However, ReMem software provides an editing suite to correct these errors at the risk of "editorialising" memories.

One of the primary applications of ReMem is in the field of therapy, where it has been used to help patients overcome trauma and phobias. It has also been used in education and training, allowing users to experience simulated scenarios and environments that would be otherwise impossible or impractical to recreate in the real world.

ReMem has received widespread praise for its potential to revolutionize the way we access and interact with our memories. However, it has also been the subject of controversy, with some critics raising concerns about the potential for the technology to be used to invade the privacy of users or manipulate their memories.
