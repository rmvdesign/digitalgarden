Invented by [[Narrative/Characters/WB Characters/Theo Rose\|Theo Rose]], founder and former CEO of [[Narrative/Factions/Corporations/Theotech, LLC\|Theotech]] LLC, The **Quantum Network** is a revolutionary technology that allows for instant communication over vast distances. It works by using two specially-designed devices called Quantum Grids, which are equipped with entangled quantum particles.

Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon in which two particles become linked together, such that the state of one particle can affect the other instantaneously, regardless of the distance between them. This phenomenon, which was first predicted by Human scientist Albert Einstein, is one of the most mysterious and fascinating aspects of quantum mechanics.

In the Quantum Network, the Quantum Grids are used to create and maintain this entanglement between particles. By manipulating the state of the particles on one grid, it is possible to instantaneously affect the particles on the other grid, even if they are separated by vast distances. This allows for the transmission of binary information – essentially, the sending of ones and zeros – over any distance.

In addition to the Quantum Grids, the Quantum Network also relies on large server facilities called Quantum Exchanges. These facilities house and maintain all of the Quantum Grids on several planets, and are responsible for connecting them to the PlaNet computer network.

The Quantum Exchanges are massive, state-of-the-art facilities that are designed to handle the complex technology of the Quantum Network. They are equipped with advanced cooling systems to keep the Quantum Grids operating at optimal temperatures, as well as redundant power systems to ensure that the network remains online at all times.

The Quantum Exchanges are also connected to each other, allowing for the Quantum Grids to be synchronised and for information to be transmitted between them. This allows for the Quantum Network to function as an interstellar network, with the ability to transmit information instantly to any point in the galaxy.
