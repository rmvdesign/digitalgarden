The Threedim, short for Three-Dimensional Mobile Terminal, is a type of handheld device used for communication, computing, and entertainment. It was developed by [[Narrative/Factions/Corporations/Theotech, LLC\|Theotech]], a leading technology company in the galaxy.

The Threedim is unique in that it uses a Quantum Grid to connect to a datacentre via quantum entanglement, allowing for fast and secure communication and data processing. The device itself has very little internal computing capabilities, as all processing is done at the datacentre.

The quintessential Threedim, the Theotech GlassType, is a chunky and thick device made from hard plastic and metal with a keypad and a small liquid-crystal display on one side, and a large Durite projection surface on the back. When the user wants to switch from basic 2D operation to 3D mode, they press a button on the side and flip the device over. From here, the device is controlled through a rocker on the side as well as basic hand gestures.

The destruction of one of the planets in the galaxy that housed a quantum exchange and datacentre resulted in the permanent loss of connectivity for the Threedims that were connected to it. This has raised questions about the resilience and reliability of the technology, as well as the potential consequences of its widespread use.
