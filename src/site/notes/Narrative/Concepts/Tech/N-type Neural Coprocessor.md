The **N-type Neural Coprocessor** (·𐑧𐑯 - 𐑑𐑲𐑐 𐑯𐑘𐑫𐑩𐑮𐑩𐑤 𐑒𐑴𐑐𐑮𐑭𐑕𐑧𐑕𐑼), also known as the N-chip, is a neurointegrated circuit developed by [[Hatena Mouru\|Hatena Mouru]] and her team at [[Narrative/Factions/Corporations/Lightspeed Industries\|Lightspeed Industries]]. The N-chip is designed to improve the cognitive abilities of artificial intelligence systems, allowing them to perform tasks with greater efficiency and accuracy. It is primarily sold as a preinstalled Add-in card for the Q-Series Android platform.

The N-chip is constructed using a proprietary blend of artificial and organic materials, including brain matter sourced from braindead children, primarily from the NewLife Hospital in Tallis City. The use of brain matter has been a closely guarded trade secret, as the public and many within the company itself are unaware of the controversial source material. A single N-chip contains 5000-10000 organic neurons captured in a conductive resin connected to a direct wide link connecting to a neural limiter.

While the N-chip has been successful in significantly enhancing the performance of AI systems, it has also been found to have unintended side effects, including the potential for the development of sentience and sapience in the systems it is installed in if the limiter it's equipped with is faulty or misconfigured.
