The Rose Field is the underlying technology behind quantum entanglement communication. It is an engineering solution to a conceptual paradox. This paradox - known as the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen Paradox - states that if two entangled particles are measured, their properties will always be the same. However, it also states that if those properties are changed by an outside force - thus, not measured, but changed - that entanglement breaks. The Rose Field is a way of maintaining this entanglement even though its properties are being actively manipulated.

The Rose Field operates by using specialized electromagnetic fields to create a "bubble" around the entangled particles, allowing them to maintain their entanglement even when their properties are being actively manipulated. The fields use a combination of quantum decoherence techniques and quantum error correction algorithms to protect the particles from outside interference, essentially "shielding" them from the effects of their environment.

The system uses a series of superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) to detect and correct any errors that may occur in the entanglement, essentially "self-healing" the particles' connection. The Rose Field is also able to actively manipulate the entangled particles, allowing for more efficient communication and information transfer.

A single quantum grid usually contains between 9 and 25 entangled particles, with 4 of these particles always being reserved for clock, error correction, authentication and coherence. The other particles are data particles, and the more there are, the higher the data throughput of a specific grid can be.
