**Ruinous objects** describe anything that's taken or inspired from the Ruins of Earth. This includes Ruinous plants like coffee, Ruinous technology like silicon semiconductors, or Ruinous media like the works of Earth poet William Shakespeare.

The term "Ruinous" has become synonymous with Earth culture and technology in many parts of the galaxy. This is due to the fact that Earth was one of the first planets in the galaxy to develop advanced technology and culture, which eventually spread to other worlds after the [[Narrative/Concepts/Death of Earth\|Death of Earth]]. As a result, many of the most important and influential technologies, art forms, and ideas in the galaxy can trace their roots back to Earth.

Because of this, the term "Ruinous" has taken on a certain cachet, and many people are drawn to objects and ideas that are associated with it. However, there are also those who reject Ruinous objects and ideas, either because they view them as a harbinger of destruction because they have a negative association with Earth's history of conflict and environmental devastation.
