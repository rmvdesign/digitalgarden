The **Martian Backup** (also known as *The Archive*, the *Lutèce Backup*, the *Martian Archive* or simply i) is a device created by Human colonists on Mars after the extinction of the human race on Earth in 2119, an event known as the [[Narrative/Concepts/Death of Earth\|Death of Earth]]. It contains a comprehensive collection of human knowledge and culture, including millions of books, billions of gigabytes of recordings, media, music, shows, games, messages, and writing. The backup was designed to be decoded by other life forms in the event that humanity is discovered by extraterrestrial civilisations in the future.

The creation of the Martian Backup was spurred by the realisation that even those who had managed to escape to Mars were not immune to the eventual extinction of the human race. As such, the colonists on Mars made it their mission to assemble a comprehensive archive of all human knowledge and culture in order to preserve it for future generations, both Human and xenote.

The Martian Backup is a testament to human perseverance and ingenuity, and serves as a beacon of hope for the future of the human race and its legacy. It is currently located in a secure facility on Mars, where it continues to serve as a lasting tribute to the achievements and creativity of the human race.

In -15, the Martian Backup was discovered by a joint exploration group consisting of [[Narrative/Species/Tallisites\|Tallisites]] and [[Narrative/Species/Navareans\|Navareans]]. The group was conducting a survey of the outer reaches of their galaxy when they stumbled upon an object of unknown origin on a xenote planet that contained the ruins of an advanced civilisation similar to [[Narrative/Species/Tallisites\|Tallisites]]. Upon closer inspection, they realised that they had found the Martian Backup, a device containing the sum of all human knowledge and culture.

The group brought the Backup back to Tallis, where it was carefully studied and decoded over the course of several years. The information contained within was a treasure trove of knowledge and cultural artefacts, allowing the [[Narrative/Species/Tallisites\|Tallisites]] and [[Narrative/Species/Navareans\|Navareans]] to learn about the history and culture of Earth and its people. The discovery also led to a renewed interest in space exploration and the search for other intelligent life forms in the galaxy.
