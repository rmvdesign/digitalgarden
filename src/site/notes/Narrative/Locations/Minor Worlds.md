# Camia 

Camia is a rocky planet with a mostly arid climate. It has a thin atmosphere and is located in a region of space with relatively low levels of radiation from its host star. Despite its dry conditions, Camia is home to a variety of hardy plant and animal life that have adapted to survive in the harsh environment. The planet's surface is dotted with sparse oases and underground water sources that support these resilient ecosystems. 

The dominant species on Camia are a race of humanoid creatures with leathery skin and large, curved horns known as Camians. They have a strong cultural tradition of resource conservation and live in small, self-sustaining communities scattered across the planet's surface. The Hora Park Rangers are mostly Camians due to their intrinstic connection with nature and conservation.

# Comprann

Comprann is a barren planet with a harsh, dry surface. However, beneath the surface lies a network of underground caves filled with rich, fertile soil. These caves are home to a vast array of plant life and are the primary source of food for the planet's inhabitants. Despite its inhospitable surface, Comprann is a thriving planet thanks to the abundance of life found in its underground caves.

The inhabitants of Comprann are a generally tall and black-skinned humanoid species that have adapted to living underground by way of using echolocation and magnetic fields to orient themselves. They are blind and have no concept of visual arts. They have developed sophisticated systems for growing food in the underground caves and have built large, interconnected cities within the caves. 

# Eddystone

Eddystone is a space station complex located in the neutral zone. It is made up of a flotilla of ships that have been retrofitted and connected to form a self-sustaining community. Eddystone is known for its focus on art and technology, with many of its inhabitants working as artisans or programmers. 

The space station is located in a remote area of the neutral zone, and is largely self-sufficient, relying on its own resources for its daily needs. Despite its isolation, Eddystone is a hub for innovation and creativity, and is respected throughout the galaxy for its contributions to the arts and technology. 

Eddystone is a closed community, and very rarely new residents are invited into Eddystone. There's also very few instances of Eddystones leaving the commune to secure higher paying work in industry, which is a testament to their commitment to the ideals of open-source labour and personal liberty. 

# Iris

Iris is a small planet located in the outer reaches of the galaxy. It is known for its vibrant, colorful atmosphere, which is a result of the planet's unique chemical composition. The atmosphere is made up of gases that reflect light in different wavelengths, creating a dazzling display of colors that can be seen from space.

Despite its small size, Iris is home to a diverse range of plant and animal life. The planet's surface is covered in lush, green forests and fields, and there are many different species of animals that call Iris home. The planet's climate is temperate, with mild winters and warm summers, making it an ideal place for life to thrive.

The inhabitants of Iris are a peaceful, communal people. They have a strong connection to the natural world, and they place a high value on harmony and cooperation. They live in small villages and towns, and they rely on each other for support and assistance.

While they are part of the galactic community, they are - perhaps paradoxically - not very interested in exploring outer space. While they are not naturalistic or opposed to the scientific method, they do value discovery on their homeworld as opposed to space.

# Ixbalanque

Ixbalanque is a small, rocky planet located on the outer reaches of the galaxy. Its surface is mostly covered in mountains and valleys, with few signs of life. However, what makes Ixbalanque unique is its location in the midst of a cloud of gaseous nebulae, which provides an unparalleled view of the stars. The planet's thin atmosphere allows for clear, uninterrupted views of the galaxy, making it a popular destination for astronomers and stargazers. Despite its lack of resources and harsh living conditions, a small community of scientists, artists and enthusiasts have made their home on Ixbalanque, drawn by the planet's stunning celestial vistas.

# Pulaski

Pulaski is a planet located on the outer rim of the known galaxy. It is known for its diverse and exotic alien species, including the Pulaskians, a sapient species with a unique form of biology. Its atmosphere is, in a near perfect 1:1 ratio, argon and oxygen.

The Pulaskians are a bipedal species with a slender, insect-like appearance. They have elongated bodies covered in a chitinous exoskeleton, which protects them from the harsh environmental conditions of Pulaski. Their bodies are segmented, with each segment containing a specialized organ or function.

The Pulaskians are highly adaptable and have evolved to thrive in their planet's varied ecosystems. They are skilled climbers and are able to navigate the dense, jungle-like forests that cover much of Pulaski. They are also able to swim through the planet's shallow, stagnant oceans with ease. Due to requiring argon for respiration, Pulaskians are rarely seen off-planet.

One of the most striking features of the Pulaskians is their ability to change the color and pattern of their exoskeleton to match their surroundings. This camouflage ability allows them to blend in with their environment and avoid predators.

Despite their formidable appearance, the Pulaskians are a peaceful species with a highly developed system of governance. They have a complex social hierarchy, with each individual having a specific role and responsibility within their community.

# Pyramiden

Pyramiden is a frozen world located in the outer reaches of the galaxy. It is known for its harsh and unforgiving climate, with temperatures often reaching well below freezing. Despite this, Pyramiden is home to a unique alien species known as the Pyramidenians.

The Pyramidenians are a hardy and resilient mammalian species, adapted to survive in the extreme conditions of their homeworld. They are covered in thick fur and have powerful, muscular bodies that allow them to withstand the cold and traverse the treacherous ice fields of Pyramiden.

Despite the challenges they face, the Pyramidenians have managed to create a thriving culture on their frozen world. They are skilled hunters and fishers, and have developed a complex system of trade and exchange with other alien species. Within the galactic community, they're seen as loyal and extremely capable manual labourers. Porters United is headquartered on Pyramiden.
