The **Navareo star system** is home to the Navarean species and the center of operations for the [[Narrative/Factions/Navareo Empire\|Navareo Empire]]. It consists of five planets, four of which are capable of supporting life and have independently developed Navarean civilizations. The orbit of the fifth planet, Navareo V, is home to the Vi Station, an arcology located on the lagrange point L3.

The Navareo star is a large class G star, classified as a G5IVf. It produces a significant amount of gamma and UV radiation, which [[Narrative/Species/Navareans\|Navareans]] are naturally resistant to due to their biology. The innermost planet, Navareo I, is the hottest due to its close proximity to the star. Navareo II, III, and IV are all capable of supporting life and have developed Navarean civilizations.

Unfortunately, Navareo IV was destroyed in an incident involving an FTL-accelerated ramjet, rendering the planet uninhabitable. Efforts to rebuild the planet using terraforming technology are ongoing and being led by Yalgeth Labs.

Despite the loss of Navareo IV, the Navareo star system remains a major hub of activity in the galaxy and is home to a diverse array of cultures and civilizations. The Vi Station, located on Navareo V, is a hub of commerce and trade, serving as a central hub for the [[Narrative/Factions/Navareo Empire\|Navareo Empire]].

Navareo I is the innermost and hottest planet in the Navareo system. It is a terrestrial planet with a thick, toxic atmosphere and a surface covered in molten lava. Despite its inhospitable conditions, Navareo I has a rich history and was once home to a thriving civilization of [[Narrative/Species/Navareans\|Navareans]]. Unfortunately, the planet was abandoned due to the increasing heat and radiation from the nearby star, and is now only used for mining operations by the [[Narrative/Factions/Navareo Empire\|Navareo Empire]]. Despite its hostile environment, Navareo I has a number of valuable resources, including rare minerals and ores that are difficult to find elsewhere in the galaxy. It was also where Theorium ore was first discovered.

Navareo II is a terrestrial planet with thick oceans of gas that are heavier than air. This gas is a mixture of several different compounds, including hydrogen, helium, and methane. The surface of the planet is dotted with small islands that are composed of solid matter, and these islands are the only places where [[Narrative/Species/Navareans\|Navareans]] can live and thrive. Navareo II is known for its extreme weather patterns, with violent storms and high winds being common occurrences. Despite the challenges of living on Navareo II, the [[Narrative/Species/Navareans\|Navareans]] have developed advanced technologies to help them survive and thrive on this inhospitable planet.

Navareo III is a terrestrial planet that is similar in many ways to Earth. It has a wide range of climates, including polar regions, deserts, and tropical rainforests. Navareo III is home to a wide variety of lifeforms, including many species of plants and animals that are native to the planet. The [[Narrative/Species/Navareans\|Navareans]] have a strong cultural connection to Navareo III, and it is considered one of the most important planets in the Navareo system.

Navareo IV was a terrestrial planet that was destroyed by an FTL-accelerated ramjet. Efforts are ongoing to rebuild the planet using terraforming technology, and the terraforming company Yalgeth Labs is leading the charge.

Navareo V is a terrestrial planet that is known for its extreme cold temperatures. It is home to the Vi Station, an arcology located on the lagrange point L3 of Navareo V's orbit. The Vi Station is a hub of trade and commerce, and it serves as the primary gateway to the Navareo system for travellers from other parts of the galaxy.

## Vi Station

The Vi Station - known is located on the Lagrange point 3 of Navareo V, which means that it is located on the far side of the planet's orbit. This location allows the station to take advantage of the planet's gravitational pull for stability, while also providing a clear view of the rest of the Navareo star system.

The station is home to a variety of different facilities and amenities, including administrative offices, living quarters, recreational areas, and more. The station is known for its luxurious accommodations, with many of the living quarters featuring large windows that offer stunning views of Navareo V and the rest of the star system.

In addition to its administrative and residential functions, the Vi Station also serves as a hub for trade and commerce in the Navareo star system. The station is home to a large number of businesses and corporations, and it is a major hub for the import and export of goods and resources.
