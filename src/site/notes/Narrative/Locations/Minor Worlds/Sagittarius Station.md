**Sagittarius Station** is a space-based settlement located in the vicinity of the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy. It is home to a diverse population of scientists, mystics, and seekers who are drawn to the black hole's enigmatic properties. Sagittarius Station is also the home base of the **Milkwalkers**.

The Milkwalkers are known for their unorthodox beliefs and practices, which revolve around the worship of the black hole and the pursuit of enlightenment through its cosmic energy.

Members of the Milkwalker cult are known for their extreme devotion to their cause, and it is rumored that they perform secretive rituals and sacrifices to appease the black hole and gain its favor. Despite their controversial beliefs and practices, the Milkwalkers have managed to remain relatively unknown to the wider galaxy, with many dismissing them as a fringe group.

However, there are whispers among those who have encountered the Milkwalkers of their otherworldly powers and abilities, which some attribute to their close proximity to the black hole and their constant exposure to its intense gravitational forces. Whether these claims are true or simply the stuff of legend remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: the Milkwalkers and their mysterious ways continue to fascinate and intrigue those who encounter them.
