The **Tholen 82W1 colony** is located on the outer rim of Navareo space and was originally settled by Navareans as a way to expand their empire. However, as the colony grew and developed its own culture and economy, it declared independence from Navareo rule. The **Tholenians** have since established themselves as a sovereign nation, relying on their own resources and trade to support their independence. The colony is known for its rich mineral deposits and advanced mining technologies, which have become a key part of their economy. 

Tholen is founder and member of the Unified Federation of Neutral Worlds, and has established trade relations with other worlds in the Neutral Zone like [[Narrative/Locations/Iris\|Iris]] and [[Narrative/Locations/Pulaski\|Pulaski]].
