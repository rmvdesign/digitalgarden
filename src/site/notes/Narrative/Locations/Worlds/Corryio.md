**Corryio** is an extra-solar colony planet under the governance of the [[Narrative/Factions/Navareo Empire\|Navareo Empire]]. With a predominantly arid climate and perilous geographical formations, the planet’s natural conditions are generally inhospitable. Yet, it finds commercial and strategic importance due to its rich deposits of natural resources and material wealth.

Much of Corryio’s landscape is marked by large manufacturing and extraction facilities, particularly in its equatorial region. These facilities, primarily dedicated to the production of machinery components and parts for hyperlight travel, play a crucial role in powering the Navarean Empire’s technological progress.

The planet’s native life forms, often characterised by their dull colouration in hues of rust and brown, have adapted to survive the harsh environmental conditions. The Navarean settlers use the local flora and fauna for a variety of applications, including as bio-feedstock and for the production of medicinal products.
