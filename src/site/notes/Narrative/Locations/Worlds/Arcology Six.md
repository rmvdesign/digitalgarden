Built originally as a massive colony ship named the NV Kvizùn, Arcology Six is the largest space station in the galaxy. It was intended to be a long-haul ship that would lead a group of about 200 000 [[Narrative/Species/Navareans\|Navareans]] to exoplanets, where they would start colonisation. However, HL travel was invented before the Kvizùn was completed, so the propulsion methods were largely removed and the station was converted into what [[Narrative/Species/Navareans\|Navareans]] now know as Arcology Six. It's placed on Lagrange point L3 of Navareo V. Colloquially, Arcology Six is also known as the Vi Station, in reference to Navareo VI.

In addition to providing permanent residence for more than half a million [[Narrative/Species/Navareans\|Navareans]], the Vi Station is also the headquarters of the Navarean administration, and the home of the Navarean Board of Directors, although they also have residences on the homeworlds.

The Vi Station is divided into multiple sections, each with a specific function. The residential section is the largest, with multiple levels of apartments, communal areas, and green spaces. The station also has research labs, industrial facilities, medical centres, and entertainment venues.

One of the most impressive features of the Vi Station is its self-sufficiency. The station has its own hydroponic gardens to provide fresh produce and a water recycling system that ensures no water is wasted. The station's energy needs are also met through renewable sources such as solar panels and wind turbines. This means that the Vi Station can function completely off the grid and does not depend on external resources for its basic needs. Additionally, the station is equipped with advanced air filtration systems that ensure the air inside is clean and healthy for the residents.

The Vi Station's research facilities are focused on a wide range of scientific fields, including astronomy, astrophysics, planetary science, geology, biology, and environmental science. The laboratories are equipped with advanced instruments and equipment for conducting experiments and analysing data.

The deep space observatory at the Vi Station is one of the most advanced in the galaxy. It includes a large radio telescope that can detect radio waves from distant galaxies and other celestial objects. The observatory is used to study the formation and evolution of stars and galaxies, as well as to search for signals from new extraterrestrial civilisations.
