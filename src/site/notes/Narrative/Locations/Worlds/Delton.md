**Delton** is the primary planet of the Delta species, categorised for its dying biosphere and inhospitable conditions reminiscent of an advanced stage of catastrophic climate deviation. Once teeming with life, Delton has suffered a drastic shift, now presenting vast expanses of desolation and a toxic atmospheric veil. 

Considered the cradle of the xenophobic Delta, a reptilian species known for their pronounced predispositions towards racial purity and galactic isolationism, Delton is at the epicentre of their cultural and societal identity. The natives' contempt for external entities emphasises a complex and exclusive hierarchical structure within Delta society.

### Habitat Preservation

Amidst the environmental ruin, the only remaining habitable zone on Delton is a remarkable structure; an "atmospheric tent" that encapsulates and preserves a sliver of liveable space. This monumental achievement in atmospheric control and environmental manipulation spans across the three remnant cities:

1. **Monolith Town** - Dominated by the relentless verticality of oppressive spires, the architecture exemplifies the ruling class's aspiration to reach beyond Delton's plight while keeping a firm boot on the populace below. The spires do not only scrape the skies but also house the surveillance apparatus that stifles dissent and perpetuates dread among the citizenry and Delecara slaves alike.
   
2. **Palace Town** - Once a beacon of Delta culture and affluence, now a facade of prosperity masks the deep inequality and exploitation that thrives within. The palatial estates are now fortresses for the ruling elite, a constant reminder to the neglected majority and enslaved Delecara of the inescapable divide that stratifies Delta society.
   
3. **Forge Town** - A gloomy, industrial metropolis, Forge Town survives through the relentless labour of the Delecara on assembly lines and in hazardous mines. The baleful glow of smelting factories and the choking fumes that escape from processing plants serve as a testament to the Delta's desperate clinging to power and a resistless industrial might, heedless of the toll on workers or the environment.

Each of these bastions of civilisation is governed by one of three prominent Delta families, each competing for supremacy in a silent battleground of subterfuge, economic machinations, and political gambits. Rather than open warfare, these families engage in a sophisticated dance of espionage, influence peddling, and covert operations, ensuring a delicate balance of power that has maintained an uneasy peace over unspeakable rivalries.

### Indigenous Cohabitation

The Delta's dominion imposed upon Delton's ecosystem also extends to the native intelligent humanoids, the Delecara. These sentient beings have been subjugated and woven into the Delta's society as an enslaved class. Their "domestication" reflects the Delta's stringent ideologies of superiority and control, with Delecara labour permitting the extravagant lifestyle and customs of the ruling species.

The Delecara's role sees them relegated to menial tasks and servile positions, forming the silent underclass that supports the three cities' contrasting cultures. Their existence is a stark reminder of the Delta's manipulative prowess and the Delecara's subdued state of sapience, coerced into subordination under the yoke of Delta's exceptionalism.

**Cultural Dynamics**

The intersection of the three cities' sociopolitical structures, the racial dichotomy between the Delta and Delecara, and the planet's ecological status combine to create a lattice of tension and interdependence. With Delton's inexorable decay serving as an ever-present backdrop, these dynamics fashion a world steeped both in the perseverance for survival and the inescapable shadows of decline.
