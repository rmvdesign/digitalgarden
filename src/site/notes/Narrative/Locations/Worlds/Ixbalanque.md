**Ixbalanque** is a small, rocky planet located on the outer reaches of the galaxy. Its surface is mostly covered in mountains and valleys, with few signs of life. However, what makes Ixbalanque unique is its location in the midst of a cloud of gaseous nebulae, which provides an unparalleled view of the stars. The planet's thin atmosphere allows for clear, uninterrupted views of the galaxy, making it a popular destination for astronomers and stargazers. Despite its lack of resources and harsh living conditions, a small community of scientists, artists and enthusiasts have made their home on Ixbalanque, drawn by the planet's stunning celestial vistas.
