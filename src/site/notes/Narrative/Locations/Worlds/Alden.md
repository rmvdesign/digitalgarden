**Alden**, prominently known as the Alden Colony, is one of the nascent colonies birthed within the celestial realm of the [[Narrative/Factions/Sundom of Eris\|Sundom of Eris]]. Uniquely positioned in the extreme vicinity of a class F0 star, Alden boasts a complex ecology and unconventional societal structures heavily influenced by this celestial feature.

The stellar classification of the nearby sun, an F0 class star, has profound implications on Alden's solar energy generation capabilities. These stars are distinguished for their intense luminosity and immense heat output, both of which are capitalised upon by Alden's cutting-edge power infrastructure. The F0 class star emits an enormous spectrum of light and thermal energy, which Alden’s engineers and designers utilise in their [[Narrative/Concepts/Tech/Solar Dust\|Solar Dust]] farms.

These [[Narrative/Concepts/Tech/Solar Dust\|Solar Dust]] farms sprawl across Alden's dayside hemisphere, capturing the ample solar radiation. [[Narrative/Concepts/Tech/Solar Dust\|Solar Dust]], microscopically fine grains of photovoltaic material, hovers in Alden's atmospheres, maximising exposure to incoming solar radiation and transforming it into usable electricity. As such, Alden has turned its stellar proximity from a potential peril into a pivotal resource, fuelling the colony’s growth. Most Dust farms are owned by the Alden Colonial Government and export to [[Narrative/Locations/Worlds/Tallis\|Tallis]] and the rest of [[Narrative/Factions/The World Unity\|the World Unity]], although private farms exist.

As well as providing abundant power, the proximity of such a warm star has necessitated innovative adaptations among the colonists. Established habitation zones are strategically built within the twilight region of the planet.
