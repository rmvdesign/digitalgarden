**Camia** is a rocky planet with a mostly arid climate. It has a thin atmosphere and is located in a region of space with relatively low levels of radiation from its host star. Despite its dry conditions, Camia is home to a variety of hardy plant and animal life that have adapted to survive in the harsh environment. The planet's surface is dotted with sparse oases and underground water sources that support these resilient ecosystems. 

The dominant species on Camia are a race of humanoid creatures with leathery skin and large, curved horns known as **Camians**. They have a strong cultural tradition of resource conservation and live in small, self-sustaining communities scattered across the planet's surface. The [[Narrative/Locations/Worlds/Hora\|Hora]] Park Rangers are mostly Camians due to their intrinstic connection with nature and conservation.
