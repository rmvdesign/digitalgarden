**Comcast Station** is the outermost Ring World, characterised by its barren exterior and remote placement on the very cusp of Ring Dwellers’ domain. Standing as the last gas stop before venturing into the bustling intergalactic avenues, it often serves as the last sight of home for explorers or as a first welcome sight for foreign vessels.

Retaining a traditional circular layout, Comcast Station incorporates a spartan design reflective of its primary operational aim—Theorium mining. Its structural simplicity is punctuated by multiple excavation and processing sites pebbled across its metallic façade. The station, while intellectually unimpressive, serves a highly important function within the Ring Dwellers’ society.

At Comcast Station, the focus is squarely on Theorium extraction. As a hub of a basic Theorium mining operation, the station harvests the vital mineral from nearby asteroids and space debris. This functional utility is compounded by its border location, allowing for better access to unexplored space and potentially untapped Theorium resources.

Besides Theorium extraction, Comcast Station evolves into a critical node in the Ring Dwellers’ intergalactic trade operations. The station serves as the first touchpoint for alien vessels—making it a cosmopolitan hotspot for exchanging goods, information and customs with the rest of the galaxy.

Comcast Station is helmed by the pragmatic and frugal House of Brin. Their leadership emphasises maximising efficiency with minimal aesthetic enhancements. The population primarily comprises mining experts, traders, star-mappers, and Theorium engineers, briefly punctuated by intergalactic travellers and merchants of all shapes, sizes and species—adding to the station’s rich tapestry of cultural diversity.
