**Ring Prime** is recognised as the capital and central hub of the Ring Dwellers’ civilisation. Distinctly different from the standard Ring Worlds, it is a combined structure consisting of a natural planet and an artificial ring that is affixed to the planet’s surface.

The merge of a planet and an artificial ring in Ring Prime creates a diverse landscape. It incorporates elements of organic terrain, including various geographical features, blended with the metallic construction of the ring.

The monumental ring, anchored into the crust of the planet, functions as a protective barrier and a centre of advanced technology. The materials utilised in its construction are developed to resist extreme environmental and seismic phenomena, thus providing an additional layer of safety to Ring Prime.
