**Vel’xivv**, often referred to in historical documents as the ‘**Original Experiment**’, is a Ring World recognised for its role as a prototype station instrumental in the development and advancement of subsequent Ring Worlds, primarily for the spacefaring race, the Ring Dwellers.

Falling relatively small in terms of size compared to other Ring Worlds, Vel’xivv features a simplistic circular layout surrounded by vast expanses of void space. A remarkable aspect of its design is its rudimentary construction, characterised by unadorned, metallic expanses and basic life-support systems.
