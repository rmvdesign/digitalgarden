**Pulaski** is a planet located on the outer rim of the known galaxy. It is known for its diverse and exotic alien species, including the Pulaskians, a sapient species with a unique form of biology. Its atmosphere is, in a near perfect 1:1 ratio, argon and oxygen.

The **Pulaskians** are a bipedal species with a slender, insect-like appearance. They have elongated bodies covered in a chitinous exoskeleton, which protects them from the harsh environmental conditions of Pulaski. Their bodies are segmented, with each segment containing a specialized organ or function.

The Pulaskians are highly adaptable and have evolved to thrive in their planet's varied ecosystems. They are skilled climbers and are able to navigate the dense, jungle-like forests that cover much of Pulaski. They are also able to swim through the planet's shallow, stagnant oceans with ease. Due to requiring argon for respiration, Pulaskians are rarely seen off-planet.

One of the most striking features of the Pulaskians is their ability to change the color and pattern of their exoskeleton to match their surroundings. This camouflage ability allows them to blend in with their environment and avoid predators.

Despite their formidable appearance, the Pulaskians are a peaceful species with a highly developed system of governance. They have a complex social hierarchy, with each individual having a specific role and responsibility within their community.
