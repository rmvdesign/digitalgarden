**Tethys** is a notable Ring World that has earned its distinction as the ancestral homeworld of a spacefaring race known as the Ring Dwellers. Its historical significance and cultural impact shape the societal and technological narratives of the Ring Dweller civilisation.

The unique construct of Tethys differs significantly from other Ring Worlds as it is built around an existing planetary body. This unusual design choice means that Tethys carries features of a traditional planet while blending the technological benefits provided by a Ring World.

Unlike newer Ring Worlds, Tethys integrates the use of ancient native stone in its structure. The resulting architectural aesthetics and archival value manifest as a distinct combination of the old and the new, showcasing the history and progress of the Ring Dwellers in a tangible form.
