**Zhia-Zhea** is a world located in the far eastern reaches of the galaxy. It is home to a unique and technologically advanced species called the Zhea. The **Zhea** are a carbon-based lifeform with a unique physiology that allows them to survive in the harsh conditions of their home planet.

Zhia-Zhea itself is a world of extreme temperatures, with scorching hot deserts and frozen tundras. The Zhea have adapted to this environment by developing insulation in their skin and the ability to regulate their internal body temperature. They also have a highly developed respiratory system that allows them to extract oxygen from the thin atmosphere.
