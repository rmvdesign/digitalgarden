**Comprann** is a barren planet with a harsh, dry surface. However, beneath the surface lies a network of underground caves filled with rich, fertile soil. These caves are home to a vast array of plant life and are the primary source of food for the planet's inhabitants. Despite its inhospitable surface, Comprann is a thriving planet thanks to the abundance of life found in its underground caves. Comprann is a member of [[Narrative/Factions/The World Unity\|The World Unity]].

The inhabitants of Comprann are a generally tall and black-skinned humanoid species that have adapted to living underground by way of using echolocation and magnetic fields to orient themselves. They are blind and have no concept of visual arts. They have developed sophisticated systems for growing food in the underground caves and have built large, interconnected cities within the caves.
