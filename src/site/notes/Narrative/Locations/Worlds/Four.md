**Four** distinguishes itself within the galactic community as a Ring World that has wholly embraced automation through an intricate network of programmable logic controllers (PLCs). The technology that drives Four is deliberately constructed from robust electromechanical components, deliberately eschewing the integrated circuitry that defines most contemporary technological systems.
#### Mechanical Automation

Within the cosmic realm where technology is vast and varying, Four's dedication to systems comprised of relays, gears, and magnetic tape is remarkable. Its PLCs function through an almost musical rhythm of mechanical movement and are an epitome of efficiency and resilience in an era where digital technology is commonplace but not ubiquitously advanced.

The PLCs curate all of Four's automation needs, driving everything from environmental control systems to the extensive mining operations that delve into the heart of the Ring World itself. Through these controllers, a seamless concert of activity courses through the vast corridors and industrial centres of Four, forging paths for the precious raw materials that are its lifeblood.
#### Mining Mastery

Four’s prowess in mining is facilitated by the precision of its unique technological system. Despite the relative simplicity of the mechanical components compared to more complex systems, the PLCs command the station's vast array of mining equipment with flawless efficacy. This mastery extends from mineral extraction to the processing and refining stages, ensuring that Four remains a dominant force in the resource markets without the aid of more contemporary electronics.
#### The People of Four

The inhabitants of Four are deeply integrated into the mechanical symphony that dictates life on the station. They are the caretakers of a vast mechanical apparatus, wielding spanners and reels of tape with the same fluency that others might manipulate a touchscreen. The ingenuity of Four’s residents is displayed in their continual refinement of the PLCs and their complex network, ensuring that the station's operations run as smoothly as the most delicately tuned clockwork.

The PLC operators, technicians, and engineers are held in high esteem, as their skills ensure the functionality and continuity of Four's economic engine. They are not just workers; they are the embodiment of a living tradition that values the tangible, the adjustable, and the serviceable.
#### Societal Impact

Four's reliance on this distinctive technology has a profound effect on its societal structure and cultural output. Efficiency is valued over extravagance, sustainability over disposability, and tactile skill over abstract innovation. The result is a Ring World with a strong sense of identity and place within the wider galaxy.

Four stands as a monument to the ingenuity of its planners and the adaptability of its people, proving that with careful stewardship and skilful hands, the oldest of technologies can still serve the future just as well as they did the past. It's a world that represents the persistence of practical, tangible engineering in a galaxy that continually marches towards the stars.
