**Telenn** is a terrestrial planet located in the middle of the galaxy, between the [[Narrative/Locations/Camia\|Camia]] system and the Corporate Sovereignty. It is known for its arid climate and unique light blue sand, which is believed to be the result of high levels of cobalt in the planet's soil. Telenn has a strong mining industry, with Theorium being a major export. The planet is also home to a number of small cities and towns, which have adapted to the harsh desert conditions through the use of advanced irrigation and water recycling systems.

Despite its seemingly inhospitable surface, Telenn is home to a diverse range of species and cultures, many of which have adapted to thrive in the arid conditions. One of the most notable resources on Telenn is Theorium, a rare and valuable ore that is used to create Theodyne, a powerful fusion fuel and catalyst.

The tech company Theotech has expressed interest in extracting Theorium from Telenn, leading to a debate among the planet's inhabitants about the potential benefits and drawbacks of such a move. While some see it as an opportunity for economic growth and development, others worry about the potential negative impacts on the planet and its inhabitants. The decision on whether to allow Theotech to extract Theorium from Telenn remains a contentious issue.
