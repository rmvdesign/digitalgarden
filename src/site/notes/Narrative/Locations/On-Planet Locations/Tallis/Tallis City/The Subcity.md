The subterranean second city of Tallis, colloquially known as "The Subcity," serves as a dynamic space beneath the bustling streets of Tallis City. This complex underground infrastructure has evolved over time, mirroring the development of the surface metropolis and catering to the diverse needs of its inhabitants.

## Architecture & Design

The Subcity boasts a unique architectural style encompassing various subterranean structures, from winding corridors resembling ancient catacombs to modern, expansive spaces infused with bioluminescent lighting. Engineers and architects have worked diligently to merge functionality with aesthetics, creating an interconnected realm that pays homage to the various cultures present in Tallis City. To accommodate the diverse populace, the design of the Subcity is intentionally modifiable, allowing communities to adapt their living spaces according to their preferences and customs.

### Modifiable by Design

The modifiable structure of the Subcity stems from a forward-thinking architectural approach, based on the principles of modular design and adaptability. By creating flexible, multi-purpose spaces capable of accommodating a variety of purposes and diverse communities, the Subcity has become a thriving underground ecosystem that harmonises with the ever-evolving needs of its inhabitants.

#### Key Elements of the Modifiable Structure

1. **Modular Construction:** The Subcity's infrastructure is built using cutting-edge modular construction techniques, which allows for the assembly and reconfiguration of living and working spaces with ease. This modularity enables architects to create versatile, efficient environs that cater to the diverse requirements of the Subcity's populace. Moreover, modular construction incorporates eco-friendly materials and sustainable design principles which contribute positively to the environment.

2. **Adaptive Repurposing:** The adaptability inherent in the Subcity's design encourages creative repurposing of spaces to accommodate changing needs. For example, a residential area can transform into a commercial or industrial zone, and vice versa, with minimal disruption. This fluidity allows the subterranean realm to respond effectively to the ever-evolving economic, social, and cultural trends that influence Tallis City.

3. **Customisable Living Spaces:** The living quarters within the Subcity are designed with flexibility in mind, allowing residents to tailor their homes according to their individual needs, preferences, and cultural backgrounds. Solutions such as movable walls, modular furniture, and smart home technology facilitate the personalisation of living spaces, empowering inhabitants to shape their immediate environment to their liking.

4. **Expandable Infrastructure:** Recognising the potential for future growth, the Subcity has been designed with an expandable infrastructure in mind. The underground realm can be extended and developed further as the population increases and new requirements arise. This foresight ensures the sustainability and continued growth of the Subcity, protecting its long-term viability alongside the surface metropolis.

5. **Interconnected Transportation System:** The modifiable structure of the Subcity is reinforced by a highly efficient and interconnected public transportation system. The subterranean Maglev trains and automated transport services seamlessly integrate with surface transportation, promoting fluidity and ease of movement throughout the Subcity and between its districts.

Thanks to its modifiable structure, the Subcity has transformed into an organic, adaptable environment whose architecture, layout, and planning continue to evolve with the needs of its inhabitants. Its emphasis on adaptability and cultural integration has made the Subcity a vibrant and vital component of the larger Tallis City ecosystem.

## Economy & Culture

The Subcity is a thriving economic centre, housing numerous businesses, markets, and industrial hubs. Specifically endorsed by off-worlders who value the subterranean environment as respite from Tallis' perpetual daylight, the Subcity benefits from a robust economy that bolsters Tallis City's overall prosperity. The myriad shops and restaurants offer a vast array of interstellar cuisines, showcasing the rich culinary heritage of Tallis City's inhabitants and attracting food enthusiasts from across the galaxy.

The Subcity is home to a vibrant array of cultural institutions and entertainment venues, including museums, galleries, and performance spaces. Various events are held throughout the year, celebrating the arts and fostering a sense of community within the Subcity's diverse population. The annual "Underworld Festival" is a highlight, showcasing local and interstellar talent whilst attracting visitors from every corner of the galaxy.
