Tallis City is the bustling capital and largest city on the planet of Tallis. Its metropolitan area is a significant department in the Tallisite government and is home to nearly 40 million inhabitants, predominantly Tallisites. The city also houses a substantial Navarean population and a thriving Irisian expat community, fostering a diverse multicultural environment.

The Irisian expats of Tallis City have established a sub-community focused on conservation and harmony with nature in the southern centre of town. This lush, green nature park – named the Irisian Gardens – has grown into a serene oasis of tranquility amidst the urban landscape, promoting the importance of environmental preservation.

Tallis City stands out as a pivotal trade and travel hub for not only the Tallis City Metro Area (TCMA) but the entire planet. Atmospheric buses facilitate rapid transfers to the orbital [[Narrative/Concepts/Society/The HyperMetro\|HyperMetro]] station, ensuring seamless access to other worlds within the galaxy. Meanwhile, state-of-the-art automatic Maglev trains connect Tallis City with other areas on the surface, enhancing inter-regional communication and commerce.

A noteworthy landmark within Tallis City is The Spire, a towering rectangular megabuilding that stands as the first of its kind on the planet. The Spire boasts a massive square footprint of nearly a kilometre in diameter and a breathtaking height of 1,052 metres. This architectural marvel serves as a symbol of the progressive spirit and innovative nature of Tallis City.

Beyond its impressive surface cityscape, Tallis City lays claim to a vast subterranean network of tunnels, underground walkways, and sub-city trains, which together create a "second city" beneath the bustling metropolis. This [[Narrative/Locations/On-Planet Locations/Tallis/Tallis City/The Subcity\|Subcity]] is home to commercial, industrial, and residential developments and is particularly popular among off-worlders who struggle to adapt to Tallis' perpetual daylight. This hidden urban layer is a testament to the ingenuity of Tallis City's design and its ability to accommodate the diverse needs of its residents while preserving harmony with the environment.
